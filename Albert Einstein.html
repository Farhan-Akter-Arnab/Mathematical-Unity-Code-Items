        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Albert Einstein</h3>
        <h4>Father of Modern Physics</h4>
        <p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist whose work revolutionized our
            understanding of
            space, time, and energy. Born in Ulm, Germany, Einstein showed exceptional aptitude in mathematics and
            physics from
            a young age. He later studied at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, where he developed the foundation
            for his
            groundbreaking theories.</p>

        <h4>Theory of Special Relativity</h4>
        <p>In 1905, Einstein published his theory of special relativity, introducing the concept that the laws of
            physics are
            the same in all inertial frames and that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant. This led to his famous
            equation:</p>
        \[
        E = mc^2
        \]
        <p>which expresses the equivalence of mass (\( m \)) and energy (\( E \)), with \( c \) representing the speed
            of light.
        </p>

        <h4>Theory of General Relativity</h4>
        <p>Einstein extended his ideas to include gravity, formulating the theory of general relativity in 1915. He
            proposed
            that massive objects curve the fabric of spacetime, and this curvature affects the motion of other objects:
        </p>
        \[
        R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
        \]
        <p>Here, \( R_{\mu\nu} \) is the Ricci curvature tensor, \( R \) is the scalar curvature, \( g_{\mu\nu} \) is
            the metric
            tensor, \( T_{\mu\nu} \) is the stress-energy tensor, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, and \( c \) is
            the
            speed of light. This theory predicted phenomena such as the bending of light by gravity and the expansion of
            the
            universe.</p>

        <h4>Other Contributions</h4>
        <p>Einstein made numerous other contributions to physics, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The photoelectric effect, explaining how light can eject electrons from a material, for which he
                received the
                Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</li>
            <li>Foundational work in quantum theory and statistical mechanics.</li>
            <li>Exploration of Brownian motion, providing evidence for the existence of atoms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>Albert Einstein’s work transformed modern physics, laying the groundwork for quantum mechanics, cosmology,
            and modern
            technologies such as GPS, nuclear energy, and lasers. Beyond his scientific achievements, he was an advocate
            for
            civil rights, pacifism, and global cooperation. Einstein remains one of the most influential scientists in
            history,
            symbolizing human curiosity and intellectual brilliance.</p>
