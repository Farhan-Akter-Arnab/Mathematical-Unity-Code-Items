        <h3>Xenocrates</h3>
        <h4>The Successor of Plato</h4>
        <p>
            Xenocrates (c. 396 BCE – 314 BCE) was an ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician, and one of Plato’s closest
            students. After Plato’s death, Xenocrates became the <b>head of the Academy in Athens</b>, serving as its scholarch
            (leader) for nearly 25 years. He played a crucial role in preserving and developing Plato’s philosophy, while also
            adding his own original contributions in metaphysics, mathematics, ethics, and logic.
        </p>
        <img src="Xenocrates.jpeg" alt="Xenocrates" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Early Life and Work with Plato</h4>
        <p>
            Born in Chalcedon, a city near Byzantium, Xenocrates became one of Plato’s most trusted pupils and even accompanied
            him to Syracuse. After Plato’s death in 347 BCE, his student Speusippus succeeded him as head of the Academy, but
            Xenocrates later took over in 339 BCE, directing the school until his death. His leadership helped solidify the
            Academy’s role as a leading center of Greek philosophical thought.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Philosophy and Contributions</h4>
        <p>
            Xenocrates developed ideas that expanded and systematized Plato’s doctrines:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Metaphysics:</b> He proposed three principles of reality—the One (unity and order), the Indefinite Dyad
                (duality and change), and the Soul (mediator between the two). This advanced Plato’s theory of Forms into a more
                structured framework.</li>
            <li><b>Mathematics:</b> He believed numbers revealed cosmic truths. Odd numbers symbolized the masculine, even
                numbers the feminine, emphasizing balance in the universe.</li>
            <li><b>Ethics:</b> Virtue was harmony of the soul, and happiness arose from living according to reason, with
                moderation and self-control at the core.</li>
            <li><b>Logic:</b> He attempted to classify different kinds of knowledge and distinguished between realities of
                thought and realities of existence.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Religious and Spiritual Beliefs</h4>
        <p>
            Xenocrates maintained that the soul was immortal and divine. He also described <i>daimones</i>—intermediate spirits
            between gods and humans—an idea that influenced Neoplatonism and later religious philosophies. His vision blended
            rational metaphysics with spiritual belief.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Character and Life</h4>
        <p>
            Renowned for his integrity and self-discipline, Xenocrates was admired for his incorruptible character. As an
            ambassador to Philip of Macedon, he impressed the king with his honesty. Though reserved and austere, he commanded
            respect from Athenians and students alike, embodying the philosopher’s life of virtue.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>
            Although most of his writings have been lost, Xenocrates’ influence endured through the Academy and subsequent
            philosophical traditions. His formalization of Plato’s ideas guided Middle Platonism and later shaped Neoplatonism
            and early Christian thought. Today, he is remembered as both a guardian and an innovator of Plato’s legacy, blending
            mathematics, metaphysics, and ethics into a unified worldview.
