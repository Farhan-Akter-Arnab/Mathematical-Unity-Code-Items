        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Mādhava of Sangamagrama</h3>
        <h4>Founder of the Kerala School and Pioneer of Infinite Series</h4>
        <p>Mādhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1340 – c. 1425 CE) was a pioneering mathematician and astronomer from Kerala,
            India. He
            is best known as the founder of the Kerala School of Mathematics and Astronomy, which flourished from the
            14th to
            16th century CE. His most groundbreaking contributions were in the realm of infinite series and the early
            development of calculus, long before Newton and Leibniz.</p>

        <h4>Birth and Background</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Born: Circa 1340 CE</li>
            <li>Place: Sangamagrama (identified with modern-day Irinjalakuda in Thrissur, Kerala)</li>
            <li>Language: Wrote in Sanskrit and Malayalam (using the Grantha script)</li>
            <li>Cultural Context: Lived in a scholarly Brahmin family with deep interest in Vedic astronomy (Jyotisha)
                and
                Ganita (mathematics).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Major Contributions</h4>
        <h5>Infinite Series and Early Calculus</h5>
        <p>Mādhava is credited with discovering infinite series expansions of trigonometric functions, such as sine,
            cosine, and
            arctangent. These were later formalized in Europe as Taylor and Maclaurin series.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>π (Pi) Series Expansion:</b><br>
                He gave a series for π:<br>
                \[\pi = 4\left(1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \cdots \right)\]<br>
                (Now known as the Gregory–Leibniz series, but Mādhava discovered it over 250 years earlier.)</li>
            <li><b>Sine and Cosine Series:</b><br>
                He derived the series for sine and cosine functions:<br>
                \[\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots\]<br>
                \[\cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots\]</li>
            <li>He also developed error terms for approximations—what would now be called remainder terms in series
                expansions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Geometry and Trigonometry</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Extended and refined trigonometric tables, using a circle of radius 3438 units (as per Indian
                tradition).</li>
            <li>Used trigonometry in accurate astronomical computations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Astronomy</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Worked on planetary motion and epicyclic models.</li>
            <li>Calculated solar and lunar eclipses using advanced mathematics.</li>
            <li>Improved upon traditional Ptolemaic models with more accurate sine functions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Works and Legacy</h4>
        <p>Though no extant text survives directly authored by Mādhava, his contributions are preserved through later
            scholars
            of the Kerala School, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nilakantha Somayaji (<i>Tantrasangraha</i>)</li>
            <li>Jyesthadeva (<i>Yuktibhāṣā</i>, the first known text to provide a rigorous foundation for calculus)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>His teachings and methods were passed orally and through palm-leaf manuscripts.</p>

        <h4>Legacy and Importance</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Founder of the Kerala School of Mathematics, which continued his work for two centuries.</li>
            <li>His techniques predated Newtonian calculus by over 250 years.</li>
            <li>Seen today as one of the world’s earliest mathematicians to approach the concept of limit, convergence,
                and
                infinite processes.</li>
            <li>Recognized posthumously for inventing calculus-like ideas in a fully Indian context, with no influence
                from
                Western mathematics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Philosophical and Cultural Impact</h4>
        <p>Mādhava and his school blended scientific reasoning with spiritual and philosophical inquiry, rooted in the
            Indian
            tradition of combining astronomy, mathematics, and cosmology. He remains a key figure in showing that
            advanced
            mathematical ideas can develop independently in different civilizations.</p>
