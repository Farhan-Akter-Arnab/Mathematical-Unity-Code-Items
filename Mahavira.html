        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Mahāvīra (c. 9th century CE)</h3>
        <h4>Indian Mathematician and Jain Scholar</h4>
        
        <p>
            Mahāvīra, also known as Mahāvīrācārya, was a prominent mathematician of 9th-century India, likely active in
            <b>Karnataka</b> under the patronage of the Rashtrakuta dynasty during King <b>Amoghavarsha’s</b> reign (814–878
            CE).
            He was influenced by the intellectual climate of Jain scholars, engaging deeply with <b>mathematics, astronomy,
                logic,</b> and <b>philosophy</b>.
            His landmark work, <i>Gaṇitasārasaṅgraha</i> (The Compendium of the Essence of Mathematics), composed around 850
            CE, became foundational for medieval Indian mathematics.

        <h4>Systematic Structure of Mathematics</h4>
        <p>
            In <i>Gaṇitasārasaṅgraha</i>, Mahāvīra organized mathematics into nine chapters covering:
            operations with numbers, fractions, rules of zero, series, geometry, permutations and combinations, and practical
            problem-solving.
            This comprehensive treatise refined and extended the works of Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, and Bhaskara I.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Zero and Negative Numbers</h4>
        <p>
            Mahāvīra extended the use of <b>zero</b> and explained arithmetic operations involving it.
            For example, subtracting a number from itself yields zero.
            He refined Brahmagupta’s earlier rules and emphasized practical applications.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Fractions and Decimals</h4>
        <p>
            He provided clear procedures for operations with fractions — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division —
            making fractional arithmetic accessible to students, merchants, and scholars.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Geometry and Mensuration</h4>
        <p>
            Mahāvīra gave rules for calculating areas and volumes of geometric figures such as triangles, quadrilaterals,
            circles, spheres, and cones.
            For example, the area of a triangle is:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
            \]
        </p>
        
        <h4>Series and Progressions</h4>
        <p>
            He studied <b>arithmetic</b> and <b>geometric progressions</b>. For instance, the sum of an arithmetic series is:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a + l)
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            where <i>a</i> is the first term, <i>l</i> is the last term, and <i>n</i> is the number of terms.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Permutations and Combinations</h4>
        <p>
            Mahāvīra discussed arrangements and selections of objects, anticipating combinatorial reasoning and building on
            <b>Pingala’s</b> earlier work on prosody.
            He included practical examples like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>“Find the number of combinations possible when choosing r items out of n.”</li>
            <li>“Given the sum of the first and last terms of an arithmetic progression and the number of terms, find the total
                sum.”</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Educational Influence:</b> <i>Gaṇitasārasaṅgraha</i> became a standard textbook in Indian mathematics for
                centuries.</li>
            <li><b>Impact on Later Scholars:</b> Influenced mathematicians such as Bhāskara II (1114–1185 CE).</li>
            <li><b>Advancement of Mathematical Knowledge:</b> Refined zero, fractions, series, geometry, and combinatorics,
                preserving and clarifying classical Indian mathematics.</li>
            <li><b>Transmission of Knowledge:</b> Mahāvīra ensured continuity of Indian mathematical traditions through the
                medieval period.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            Mahāvīra exemplifies the Jain tradition of systematic and rigorous mathematics, blending practical computation,
            geometric reasoning, and combinatorial insight.
            His treatise stands as a cornerstone in the continuity and enrichment of Indian mathematical knowledge.
