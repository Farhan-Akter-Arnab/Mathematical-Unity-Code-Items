        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Ogura Kinnosuke</h3>
        <h4>Japanese Historian of Mathematics</h4>
        <p>
            Ogura Kinnosuke (1882–1962) was a Japanese mathematician and historian of mathematics who made lasting contributions
            to the study of number theory and the history of East Asian mathematics. Trained in modern Western mathematics,
            Ogura also devoted himself to recovering and analyzing Japan’s indigenous mathematical tradition, Wasan.
        </p>

        <p>
            His research in number theory included work on congruences and Diophantine equations, which involve finding integer
            solutions to polynomial equations such as:
            \[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]
            These investigations connected him to classical problems in arithmetic while also reflecting the influence of modern
            algebraic number theory.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a historian, Ogura published important studies on the development of Wasan, including the works of Seki Takakazu
            and his successors. By applying rigorous historical methods, he demonstrated how Japanese mathematicians
            independently developed theories of determinants, infinite series, and algebraic equations. His comparative studies
            highlighted both the originality and limitations of Wasan relative to European traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ogura’s dual role as mathematician and historian made him a key figure in shaping Japan’s intellectual
            self-understanding during the 20th century. He ensured that Japan’s indigenous contributions were not forgotten
            while also promoting the integration of Japanese mathematics into the global history of science.
