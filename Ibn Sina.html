        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Ibn Sina (Avicenna)</h3>
        <h4>Polymath of Philosophy, Medicine, and Natural Science</h4>
        <p>Ibn Sina (980 – 1037 CE), known in the West as Avicenna, was a Persian polymath whose achievements span
            philosophy,
            medicine, astronomy, mathematics, physics, and more. Born near Bukhara under the Samanid dynasty, he became
            a
            renowned physician and philosopher, authoring over 450 works—approximately 240 survive today.<br>
            The <b>Book of Healing</b> (<i>Kitāb al‑Shifāʾ</i>, c. 1027 CE) is a vast encyclopedia covering logic,
            natural
            sciences, mathematics, and metaphysics, while his <b>Canon of Medicine</b> (<i>Al‑Qānūn fī al‑Ṭibb</i>,
            1025 CE)
            became the standard medical reference in both the Islamic world and medieval Europe.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Astronomy and Mathematics</h4>
        <p>Ibn Sina made important contributions to mathematical astronomy and optics. He clearly distinguished
            <i>mathematical
                astronomy</i> from astrology, and critically examined Ptolemaic models when they contradicted observed
            phenomena.
        </p>
        <p>Notable achievements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reported observing a possible <b>transit of Venus</b> or a sunspot on May 24, 1032, using it to argue
                that Venus
                can come between Earth and the Sun.</li>
            <li>Described the <b>supernova SN 1006</b>, noting how its brightness varied over months — one of the
                earliest known
                supernova observations.</li>
            <li>Devised precision instruments for angular measurements, anticipating the <i>vernier principle</i>, for
                determining celestial longitude based on lunar culmination.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Philosophy of Science and Physics</h4>
        <p>In <i>The Book of Healing</i>, Ibn Sina promoted a scientific method combining <b>observation</b>,
            <b>rational
                logic</b>, and <b>experimentation</b>. He advocated deriving universal principles from empirical data
            and reason
            — a key development in the evolution of the scientific method.
        </p>

        <p>He introduced a concept similar to inertia, proposing that motion continues due to an imparted <i>mayl</i>
            (impetus),
            which only ceases due to external resistance. This idea foreshadows Newton’s First Law of Motion. In modern
            terms,
            he essentially stated:</p>
        <p>
            \[
            \text{If } F = 0, \text{ then } v = \text{constant}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>This was centuries before Galileo and Newton formalized it.</p>

        <h4>Medical and Metaphysical Works</h4>
        <p>His <i>Canon of Medicine</i> was a comprehensive synthesis of Greco-Roman, Persian, and Indian medicine. It
            introduced:
        <ul>
            <li>Systematic clinical trials</li>
            <li>Diagnosis through observation</li>
            <li>Quarantine for infectious diseases</li>
            <li>Descriptions of ailments like diabetes, tuberculosis, and cataracts</li>
        </ul>
        It remained in use as a textbook across Europe until the 17th century.</p>

        <p>In metaphysics, he formulated the <b>doctrine of emanation</b>—arguing that all beings proceed from the
            Necessary
            Existent (God), through a hierarchy of intelligences. This model heavily influenced both Islamic
            philosophers and
            later Scholastics like Thomas Aquinas.</p>

        <h4>Logical and Epistemological Innovations</h4>
        <p>Ibn Sina developed advanced theories of cognition, introducing the concept of an <b>Active Intellect</b>—an
            immaterial agent enabling humans to grasp abstract knowledge. He also proposed the famous <b>Floating
                Man</b>
            thought experiment:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If a person were created fully formed but suspended in air, cut off from all sensory input, he would
                still be
                aware of his own existence.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This was an early argument for <i>self-awareness</i> as independent of sensory perception, and thus for the
            soul’s
            immateriality.</p>

        <h4>Legacy and Influence</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Unified Greek, Persian, and Islamic intellectual traditions into one philosophical system</li>
            <li>Helped lay the groundwork for modern logic, scientific reasoning, and metaphysical inquiry</li>
            <li>His <i>Canon</i> remained the cornerstone of European medicine for centuries</li>
            <li>Inspired key figures like Averroes, Aquinas, and Roger Bacon</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ibn Sina remains one of the greatest thinkers of the Islamic Golden Age, symbolizing the synthesis of
            philosophy,
            science, and medicine in medieval intellectual history.</p>
