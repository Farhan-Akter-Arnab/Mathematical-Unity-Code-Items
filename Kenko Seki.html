        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Kenkō Seki</h3>
        <h4>Father of Japanese Mathematics</h4>
        <p>Kenkō Seki (1642–1708) was a pioneering Japanese mathematician of the Edo period, often regarded as the
            father of
            Japanese mathematics, or <em>wasan</em>. Despite Japan’s isolation from the Western world, Seki developed
            mathematical ideas that paralleled and sometimes anticipated those in Europe, making his work an independent
            marvel
            in mathematical history.</p>
        <img src="Kenko Seki.webp" alt="Kenko Seki" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Early Life and Education</h4>
        <p>Born in Fujioka, in present-day Gunma Prefecture, Seki came from a samurai family but chose a scholarly life
            over a
            military career. Initially studying Chinese arithmetic from texts such as <em>The Nine Chapters on the
                Mathematical
                Art</em>, he soon began producing original methods that went beyond his sources.</p>
        <p>By the early 1680s, Seki had already established himself as the leading figure in Japanese mathematics,
            attracting
            students from across the country.</p>

        <h4>Algebraic Innovations</h4>
        <p>Seki’s <em>Katsuyō Sanpō</em> (Essentials of Mathematics, c. 1683) introduced methods for solving systems of
            equations and calculating determinants — concepts that would not formally appear in Europe until over a
            century
            later. His elimination methods resembled modern matrix techniques and showed a deep understanding of
            algebraic
            structure.</p>

        <h4>Mathematical Notation and Methods</h4>
        <p>Seki developed a symbolic computation system known as <em>tenzan jutsu</em>. This notation used vertical
            arrangements
            and kanji symbols to represent variables and operations, enabling him to handle advanced problems in
            polynomial
            equations and geometry.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Symbolic notation using kanji for unknowns</li>
            <li>Vertical arrangement of expressions</li>
            <li>Techniques for polynomial equation solving</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Contributions to Geometry</h4>
        <p>Seki made significant contributions to geometry, including methods for computing areas and volumes, as well
            as
            solving complex geometric puzzles. His influence can be seen in the tradition of <em>sangaku</em> — wooden
            tablets
            hung in temples with challenging geometric problems.</p>

        <h4>Achievements in Determinants</h4>
        <p>One of Seki’s most striking accomplishments was his work on determinants, which he referred to as
            <em>enri</em>
            ("circle principle"). His methods anticipated the later European work of Cramer and Vandermonde by more than
            a
            century, showing that advanced algebraic concepts were developing independently in Japan.
        </p>

        <h4>Teaching and Mathematical School</h4>
        <p>Seki trained many students and founded a school of mathematics whose teachings shaped the direction of
            <em>wasan</em>
            for generations. His school’s influence lasted into the 19th century, bridging the gap between Japan’s
            pre-modern
            and modern mathematical traditions.
        </p>

        <h4>Final Years and Legacy</h4>
        <p>Kenkō Seki passed away in 1708, leaving behind a body of work that ensured Japan’s place in the global
            history of
            mathematics. His independent discoveries demonstrate the universality of mathematical thought and the
            ability of
            human creativity to flourish in any cultural setting.</p>
        <p>Today, Seki is remembered as a symbol of Japan’s rich mathematical heritage — a figure whose insights
            continue to
            inspire both historians and mathematicians worldwide.</p>
