        <h3>Cleomedes</h3>
        <h4>Greek Astronomer and Natural Philosopher</h4>
        <p>
            Cleomedes (fl. late 1st or early 2nd century CE) was a Greek astronomer and natural philosopher, known for his
            preserved treatise <i>On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies</i>. This work serves as one of the most
            important sources for our knowledge of ancient astronomy, preserving doctrines of earlier thinkers like Posidonius,
            Hipparchus, and Eratosthenes.
        </p>
        <img src="Cleomedes.jpeg" alt="Cleomedes" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Cleomedes’ treatise was essentially a textbook of astronomy for students, blending mathematical reasoning with
            natural philosophy. He explained basic geometrical models of planetary motion, such as the eccentric and epicyclic
            theories, which were designed to account for irregularities in planetary paths while maintaining uniform circular
            motion. His explanations often drew on simple geometrical constructions, making mathematical astronomy more
            accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of Cleomedes’ most significant contributions was his account of Eratosthenes’ measurement of the Earth’s
            circumference. He explained how Eratosthenes used the difference in the Sun’s zenith angle at Syene and Alexandria
            at the summer solstice to calculate the Earth’s size, obtaining a figure of approximately 252,000 stadia. Cleomedes
            preserved this geometric reasoning, which otherwise might have been lost.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cleomedes also discussed the geometry of eclipses, the phases of the Moon, and the apparent brightness of stars. He
            emphasized the spherical nature of the Earth, providing arguments from lunar eclipses, star visibility, and the
            curvature of the horizon. His work contains one of the clearest expositions of the idea that Earth is suspended in
            space as a sphere, not resting on any support.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Cleomedes himself may not have been a highly original theorist, his role as a transmitter and explicator of
            mathematical astronomy was vital. His clear presentation of geometrical reasoning in astronomy influenced later
            Byzantine and Islamic scholars. In this way, Cleomedes ensured the survival of core mathematical and astronomical
            concepts from the Hellenistic tradition into late antiquity and beyond.
