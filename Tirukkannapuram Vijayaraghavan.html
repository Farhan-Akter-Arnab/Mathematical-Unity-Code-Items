        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Tirukkannapuram Vijayaraghavan</h3>
        <h4>Pioneer of Summability and Number Theory in India</h4>
        <p>
            Tirukkannapuram Vijayaraghavan (1902 – 1955) was a prominent Indian mathematician known for his contributions to
            analysis and number theory. Born in 1902 in Tamil Nadu, India, he showed early promise in mathematics, completing
            his studies at the <b>University of Madras</b> before moving to England for advanced research. At <b>Cambridge
                University</b>, he worked under the mentorship of <b>G. H. Hardy</b>, one of the most influential mathematicians
            of the early 20th century. This mentorship not only shaped his career but also linked him to the mathematical
            tradition of <b>Srinivasa Ramanujan</b>, who had also been guided by Hardy.

        <h4>Mathematical Contributions</h4>
        <p>
            Vijayaraghavan made significant contributions in <b>analysis</b> and <b>number theory</b>, particularly in the study
            of <b>summability methods</b> and <b>divergent series</b>. One of his key achievements is associated with the
            <b>Vijayaraghavan theorem</b>, which refined results in <b>Cesàro summability</b>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In Cesàro summability, a series
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[ S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots \]
        </p>
        
        <p>
            is assigned a value if the averages of its partial sums converge. The sequence of averages is defined as:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[ n = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \]
        </p>
        
        <p>
            and if \( n = L \), then the series is said to be <b>Cesàro summable</b> to \( L \). Vijayaraghavan strengthened
            these results, identifying conditions under which such summability methods could be generalized, paving the way for
            deeper insights into <b>Tauberian theorems</b>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            He also conducted influential work on <b>uniform distribution</b> and <b>Diophantine approximation</b>, exploring
            how well real numbers can be approximated by rationals. His research extended Ramanujan’s legacy in number theory,
            incorporating rigorous analytic techniques that set a new standard for mathematical research in India.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Legacy and Impact</h4>
        <p>
            Upon returning to India, Vijayaraghavan became one of the founding faculty members of the <b>Tata Institute of
                Fundamental Research (TIFR)</b> in Bombay (now Mumbai). There, he was instrumental in establishing <b>number
                theory</b> and <b>analysis</b> as serious fields of research in India, mentoring a new generation of
            mathematicians who would build upon his work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Tragically, Vijayaraghavan's career was cut short when he passed away in 1955 at the age of just 53. Despite his
            early death, his pioneering research in summability and number theory remains influential. Today, he is remembered
            as one of the key figures who carried <b>Ramanujan’s spirit of discovery</b> into a more rigorous and modern
            mathematical framework.
