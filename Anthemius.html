        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Anthemius of Tralles</h3>
        <h4>Geometer, Engineer, and Architect of Hagia Sophia</h4>
        <p>
            Anthemius of Tralles (c. 474 – mid-6th century CE) was a Byzantine mathematician and architect best known as one of
            the co-designers of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. He combined advanced geometric knowledge with practical
            engineering, applying theoretical principles to the design and construction of monumental structures.
        </p>
        <img src="Anthemius.webp" alt="Anthemius" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Anthemius studied conic sections and optical phenomena, particularly the reflective properties of parabolic and
            elliptical surfaces. In his treatise <i>On Burning Mirrors</i>, he analyzed how curved mirrors could focus light and
            heat, demonstrating an understanding of ray optics that connected mathematics to physics. These studies illustrate
            the integration of pure and applied mathematics in Byzantine engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            In architecture, Anthemius applied geometric reasoning to design pendentives, domes, and arches that could sustain
            massive weights and maintain structural stability. His use of geometry in spatial problem-solving foreshadowed
            modern structural analysis. For example, he considered the curvature of domes and calculated how forces were
            transmitted along arches and vaults, anticipating later developments in statics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anthemius’ work exemplifies the practical application of mathematics in real-world engineering. He ensured that
            theoretical constructs, such as conic sections, became tools for solving structural and optical problems. His blend
            of theory, observation, and experimentation influenced Byzantine architectural practice and preserved a lineage of
            applied geometry for future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through his contributions, Anthemius represents a rare combination of mathematician, scientist, and architect,
            demonstrating how geometry could inform and guide the creation of enduring monuments.
