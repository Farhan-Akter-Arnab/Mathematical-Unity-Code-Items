        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Raj Chandra Bose</h3>
        <h4>Pioneer of Combinatorics, Statistics, and Coding Theory</h4>
        <p>
            Raj Chandra Bose (1901 – 1987) was a distinguished Indian mathematician whose work bridged pure and applied
            mathematics. He was born on <b>June 19, 1901</b>, in Hoshangabad, Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh),
            India.
            Initially pursuing physics at <b>Presidency College, Calcutta</b>, he later shifted his interest to
            mathematics
            under the guidance of the eminent statistician <b>P. C. Mahalanobis</b>, founder of the <b>Indian
                Statistical
                Institute (ISI)</b>. Soon after joining ISI, Bose established himself as a brilliant problem-solver in
            the
            emerging fields of <b>combinatorics</b>, <b>design theory</b>, and <b>statistics</b>.
        </p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Mathematical Contributions</h4>
        <p>
            Bose’s earliest influential work was in <b>finite geometry</b> and <b>combinatorial design theory</b>, where
            he
            formalized the principles of <b>Balanced Incomplete Block Designs (BIBDs)</b>. These designs became critical
            tools
            for conducting large-scale statistical experiments in agriculture, medicine, and industry, enabling
            efficiency while
            ensuring accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>
            A BIBD with parameters \((v, b, r, k, \lambda)\) satisfies the standard relations:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[
            v \cdot r = b \cdot k
            \]
            \[
            r (k - 1) = \lambda (v - 1)
            \]
            \[
            \lambda v (v - 1) = b k (k - 1)
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            Here:
        <ul>
            <li><b>v</b> = number of treatments</li>
            <li><b>b</b> = number of blocks</li>
            <li><b>r</b> = number of times each treatment is repeated</li>
            <li><b>k</b> = size of each block</li>
            <li><b>\(\lambda\)</b> = number of times each pair of treatments occurs together</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Another landmark achievement was in <b>coding theory</b>, where Bose co-developed algebraic error-correcting
            codes
            that laid the foundation for the <b>BCH (Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem) codes</b>. The algebraic basis of such
            cyclic
            codes can be expressed as follows: choose a polynomial \( g(x) \) dividing \( x^n - 1 \) in the polynomial
            ring over
            the finite field \( GF(q) \). The cyclic code generated by \( g(x) \) is:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[
            C = \{ m(x) g(x) \;|\; m(x) \in GF(q), \; \deg(m(x)g(x)) < n \} \] </p>

                <p>
                    In many practical BCH constructions, one takes \( n = q^m - 1 \) and a generator polynomial whose
                    roots are
                    consecutive powers of a primitive element of \( GF(q^m) \).
                </p>

                <h4>Legacy and Impact</h4>
                <p>
                    In 1959, Bose moved to the <b>United States</b>, serving as professor of statistics and mathematics
                    at the
                    <b>University of North Carolina</b> and later at <b>Colorado State University</b>. There, he
                    mentored
                    generations of mathematicians and engineers, influencing diverse applications of mathematics in
                    science and
                    technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    His pioneering insights earned him <b>international recognition</b>, making him one of the few
                    Indian
                    mathematicians of his era to achieve global prominence in <b>combinatorics</b>, <b>statistics</b>,
                    and
                    <b>coding theory</b>. Bose’s work demonstrated that mathematics could transcend abstraction and
                    drive
                    practical innovation in fields such as <b>communication systems</b> and <b>data transmission</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Raj Chandra Bose passed away on <b>October 31, 1987</b>, in Colorado, USA. Today, his name lives on
                    in
                    <b>Bose–Chaudhuri codes</b>, <b>design theory</b>, and in the thriving mathematical community that
                    continues
                    to build upon his groundbreaking methods. He remains a shining example of how a mathematician can
                    bridge
                    theory and practice, leaving behind a legacy that powers much of modern communication technology.
