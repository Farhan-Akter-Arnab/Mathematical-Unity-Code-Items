    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>Here are the three founders of the Mathematical Unity [Ulus Riyadiyat], who helped to shape the community and add interesting things to it. Anyways, here are their short identity:</p>

    <p>This group is mainly originated in Bangladesh by some students who like Mathematics, Science and other things. We try to find out some interesting facts on Mathematics, Science and try to solve them. The topics discussed here range from Number Theory, Algebra, Geometry to Physics, Chemistry and other various things. Here we try to maintain that the topics do not become dull or uninteresting, but rather engaging to others. <strong>Horsey Math News are also discussed in our community.</strong> Those who are interested can join our Discord Server that one can find in the footer section.</p>

    <p>We are also trying to make this website as a hub for all the Mathematical and Scientific things, where one can find interesting facts, news, articles, etc. We hope that you will like our work and support us in our journey. Hail Mathematics!</p>
