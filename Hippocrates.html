        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Hippocrates of Chios</h3>
        <h4>Early Greek Pioneer of Geometry</h4>

        <p>Hippocrates of Chios (c. 470–410 BC) was an early Greek mathematician whose work marked a turning point in
            the
            systematic study of geometry. Born on the island of Chios, he began his career as a merchant engaged in
            maritime
            trade. According to ancient sources, his life took a dramatic turn after he was defrauded during a voyage,
            losing
            his cargo to piracy or deceit. Determined to rebuild his life, he traveled to Athens, where he immersed
            himself in
            mathematics and quickly gained recognition for his remarkable talent in geometric reasoning.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Mathematical Achievements</h4>
        <p>Hippocrates became one of the first known individuals to compile a geometric textbook—an early precursor to
            Euclid’s
            <em>Elements</em>—in which he organized the geometric knowledge of his time into a logically ordered
            sequence of
            theorems and proofs. This work applied <strong>deductive reasoning</strong> rather than relying solely on
            visual
            intuition, setting a standard for mathematical rigor that influenced generations of Greek mathematicians.
            Although
            his original text is lost, fragments and descriptions preserved by later commentators such as Proclus and
            Simplicius
            confirm that Hippocrates established a structured foundation for geometry.
        </p>

        <h4>The Quadrature of Lunes</h4>
        <p>Hippocrates is best remembered for his work on the <em>quadrature of lunes</em>, a remarkable attempt to
            bridge
            straight-line geometry with curved figures. The term “lune” refers to a crescent-shaped area bounded by two
            circular
            arcs. While the classical problem of <em>squaring the circle</em>—constructing a square of the same area as
            a given
            circle using only a compass and straightedge—was ultimately proven impossible in modern mathematics (due to
            the
            transcendence of \( \pi \)), Hippocrates discovered that certain specific lunes could be exactly squared.
        </p>

        <p>For example, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse of length \( c \) and legs \( a \) and \( b \), and we
            construct
            semicircles on each side, the area of the lune on the hypotenuse equals the combined area of the two lunes
            on the
            legs. This follows from the Pythagorean relationship:</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
            \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)
        </p>

        <p>and the area of a semicircle of diameter \( d \) being \( \frac{\pi d^2}{8} \). By rearranging these areas,
            Hippocrates showed that certain lunes had the same area as a given triangle, achieving an exact quadrature
            without
            approximations.</p>

        <h4>Other Contributions</h4>
        <p>Beyond lunes, Hippocrates worked on the properties of circles, proportions, and the <em>method of
                reduction</em>—breaking complex geometric problems into simpler, solvable ones. This approach
            anticipated
            techniques later formalized in Greek mathematics and remains a fundamental strategy in problem-solving
            today. His
            methods provided a bridge between earlier empirical observations and the formal axiomatic systems that would
            later
            define the discipline.</p>

        <h4>Legacy and Influence</h4>
        <p>Although none of Hippocrates’ writings survive in their original form, his influence can be traced through
            the works
            of later mathematicians. Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> adopted the structured, theorem-proof format that
            Hippocrates
            helped pioneer, while Archimedes and Apollonius benefited from the conceptual shift toward rigorous
            abstraction.
            Hippocrates’ achievements represented a move away from practical measurement toward theoretical mathematics
            as an
            autonomous, logical science. His name remains permanently associated with the earliest successful attempts
            to
            measure curved areas and with the intellectual transformation of Greek geometry into a deductive discipline.
