                Greek Mathematics: From Cosmos to Calculation
            </h3>
            <p>
                Ancient Greece nurtured mathematical thought that blossomed into the foundations of geometry, logic,
                astronomy, and
                philosophical analysis.
                Greek mathematicians were driven by a quest for rational order—seeking patterns in the heavens, rigor in
                proofs, and
                harmony in numbers.
                From natural philosophers like Thales, who sought to explain the world without myth, to Archimedes, who
                mastered
                geometry and invented machinery,
                these thinkers built the pillars of logical inquiry and quantitative reasoning that continue to underpin
                modern
                science.
