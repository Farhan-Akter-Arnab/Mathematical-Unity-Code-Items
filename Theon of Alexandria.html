        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Theon of Alexandria</h3>
        <h4>Editor, Commentator, and Pedagogue of Late Antique Mathematics</h4>
        <h5><i><strong>Not to be confused with <a href="Theon of Smyrna.html" style="color:white;">Theon of Smyrna!!! (Clickable Link)</a></strong></i></h5>
        <p>
            Theon of Alexandria (c. 335–c. 405 CE) was a mathematician, astronomer, and teacher whose principal legacy is
            editorial and pedagogical: his recension of Euclid’s <i>Elements</i> and his commentaries on Ptolemy’s works shaped
            how geometry and computational astronomy were read for many centuries. Operating within the Alexandrian scholarly
            milieu, Theon aimed to make difficult classical texts usable in the classroom by standardizing diagrams, correcting
            corrupt passages, supplying scholia (marginal notes), and inserting worked examples intended for students and
            practising astronomers.
        </p>
        <img src="Theon of Alexandria.jpg" alt="Theon of Alexandria" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            As an editor he exercised judgement about textual variants and diagrammatic presentation: his edition of the
            <i>Elements</i> fixed the ordering of propositions and the appearance of key figures so that proofs became easier to
            follow in a lecture setting. He also augmented computational practice—especially for astronomical tables—by
            clarifying procedures and showing explicit numerical steps. A typical computational technique he helped render
            teachable was linear interpolation between tabulated values; in modern notation one often writes a simple
            interpolant as
            \[
            f(x)\approx f(x_0) + \frac{f(x_1)-f(x_0)}{x_1-x_0}\,(x-x_0),
            \]
            a method of the kind used in late-antique astronomical handbooks to extract intermediate quantities from coarse
            tables.
        </p>
        <p>
            In astronomy Theon is associated with commentaries and practical expositions that made Ptolemaic methods accessible:
            e.g., explanation of chord/sine usage, eclipse computation recipes, and instrument practice (such as the use of the
            astrolabe). For trigonometric relations he and his circle worked within the chord-based framework that Ptolemy used,
            where
            \[
            \text{chord}(\theta)=2R\sin\!\left(\tfrac{\theta}{2}\right),
            \]
            and emphasized how to apply such relations to concrete calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Theon’s pedagogical orientation had long-term consequences: his editorial choices influenced the manuscript
            tradition that Byzantine scholars and later Arabic translators inherited, and his daughter Hypatia—one of the
            best-known late-antique teachers—carried forward the Alexandrian instructional style. Though Theon is not remembered
            primarily for original theorems, his careful editorial hand, commitment to clarity, and attention to worked
            computation were decisive in preserving, organizing, and transmitting the Hellenic mathematical corpus to subsequent
            generations.
