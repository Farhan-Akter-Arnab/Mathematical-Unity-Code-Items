        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Leucippus</h3>
        <h4>The Founder of Atomism</h4>
        <p>
            Leucippus (c. 5th century BCE) was a Greek philosopher, traditionally regarded as the
            <strong>originator of atomism</strong>, one of the earliest scientific theories of matter.
            Very little is known about his life — some ancient sources even doubted whether he truly existed
            or confused him with his student <strong>Democritus</strong>. Nevertheless, most historians agree
            that Leucippus laid the foundation of atomism, a theory that profoundly shaped the history of science.
        </p>
        <img src="Leucippus.webp" alt="Leucippus" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>The Theory of Atomism</h4>
        <p>
            Leucippus proposed that the universe is composed of two fundamental realities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Atoms</strong>: tiny, indivisible, eternal particles that form everything</li>
            <li><strong>Void (Empty Space)</strong>: the space in which atoms move and interact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This was revolutionary, since philosophers such as Parmenides and Zeno denied the existence of void.
            Leucippus argued instead that <em>without empty space, motion would be impossible</em>.
            He described atoms as infinite in number, varied in shape and size, indivisible, indestructible,
            and in constant motion.
        </p>
        
        <h4>The Formation of the Universe</h4>
        <p>
            Rejecting mythological explanations, Leucippus explained nature mechanistically:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Atoms move randomly in the void.</li>
            <li>Through collisions, they join into larger structures.</li>
            <li>Over time, these clusters form the objects, materials, and living beings of the world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This naturalistic explanation was among the first attempts to describe the cosmos without
            appealing to divine intervention.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Determinism and Causality</h4>
        <p>
            Leucippus is credited with an early form of <strong>determinism</strong>, holding that
            events follow necessity and natural law rather than chance. One of his rare surviving statements is:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “Nothing occurs at random, but everything from reason and by necessity.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This principle influenced later philosophy and science by asserting that the universe operates in a predictable,
            rational order.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Influence on Democritus and Later Thinkers</h4>
        <p>
            Although Leucippus introduced atomism, it was his student <strong>Democritus</strong> who elaborated
            it into a full philosophical system, including explanations of thought and the soul. Centuries later,
            the Roman poet <strong>Lucretius</strong> revived atomism in his work <em>On the Nature of Things</em>.
            In the modern era, atomism inspired the foundations of physics and chemistry, culminating in
            <strong>John Dalton’s atomic theory</strong> (19th century).
        </p>
        
        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>
            Though none of his works survive in full, Leucippus is remembered as the first thinker to propose
            that the world is composed of <strong>invisible building blocks</strong> moving through empty space.
            This concept anticipated modern science by more than 2,000 years, securing his place as the
            <strong>founder of atomism</strong> and a pioneer of natural philosophy.
        </p>
