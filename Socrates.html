        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Socrates</h3>
        <h4>Ancient Greek Philosopher and Founder of Western Philosophy</h4>
        <p>Socrates (c. 470 – 399 BCE) is often regarded as the father of Western philosophy and one of the most
            influential
            thinkers in history. Born in Athens during its Golden Age, he lived through the city’s rise and fall in the
            Peloponnesian War. Socrates came from humble origins, working as a stonemason in his early life, yet devoted
            himself
            to the pursuit of wisdom and the examination of human life. He did not write any works himself; most of what
            we know
            about him comes from his students, especially Plato, and from other contemporaries such as Xenophon and the
            playwright Aristophanes.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>The Socratic Method</h4>
        <p>Socrates developed the <em>Socratic Method</em>, a way of teaching through questioning and dialogue. This
            method
            involved asking a series of probing questions to expose contradictions in a person’s beliefs, encouraging
            them to
            think more clearly and logically. By leading his interlocutors to examine their own ideas, Socrates sought
            to
            uncover definitions of abstract concepts such as justice, virtue, courage, and piety.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encouraged critical thinking and self-examination.</li>
            <li>Exposed assumptions and inconsistencies in arguments.</li>
            <li>Promoted dialogue as a means to discover truth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He believed that the pursuit of virtue and wisdom was more important than wealth or power, famously declaring
            that
            “the unexamined life is not worth living.”</p>

        <h4>Focus on Ethics and Virtue</h4>
        <p>Socrates was less concerned with natural science than many earlier Greek thinkers, focusing instead on how
            people
            should live and what it means to live a good life. He believed that knowledge and virtue were inseparable —
            that to
            truly know what is right is to do what is right. This moral philosophy formed the ethical foundation for
            much of
            Western thought.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Virtue is the highest good.</li>
            <li>Ignorance is the root of wrongdoing.</li>
            <li>Wisdom begins with recognizing one’s own ignorance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Trial and Death</h4>
        <p>In 399 BCE, Socrates was put on trial in Athens on charges of impiety and “corrupting the youth” by
            encouraging them
            to question traditional beliefs and authority. Found guilty by a narrow margin, he was sentenced to death by
            drinking poison hemlock. Rejecting the chance to escape, Socrates accepted his fate, choosing to uphold his
            principles and obey the law even at the cost of his life.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Faced trial before a jury of 500 Athenians.</li>
            <li>Defended his mission as a moral duty to question and seek truth.</li>
            <li>Died calmly, discussing philosophy until the final moments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>His death became a symbol of intellectual integrity and courage in the face of injustice.</p>

        <h4>Legacy and Influence</h4>
        <p>Socrates’ life and ideas profoundly shaped the development of philosophy. Through the works of Plato and
            Aristotle,
            his methods and teachings influenced countless generations of thinkers. The Socratic Method remains a
            cornerstone of
            philosophical inquiry, legal education, and debate. His emphasis on reason, ethics, and dialogue helped lay
            the
            foundations for Western intellectual tradition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plato (his most famous student)</li>
            <li>Aristotle</li>
            <li>Stoic and Cynic philosophers</li>
            <li>Modern educational and legal questioning techniques</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Socrates’ true importance lies not in any single doctrine but in his way of seeking knowledge — through
            relentless
            questioning, logical reasoning, and the belief that truth can be discovered through human inquiry.</p>
