        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee</h3>
        <h4>The Tiger of Bengal and Architect of Modern Education in India</h4>
        <p>
            Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee (1864 – 1924), widely known as the “Tiger of Bengal,” was a polymath, mathematician, jurist,
            and visionary educationist. Born on June 29, 1864, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, he demonstrated brilliance
            early in life. He studied mathematics at Presidency College, Calcutta, earning dual degrees in mathematics and
            physics, and completed a doctorate in mathematics in 1887. Later, he pursued law and became a successful barrister,
            yet his passion for mathematics and education never waned.
        </p>
        <img src="Ashutosh Mukherjee.webp" alt="Ashutosh Mukherjee" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Mathematical Contributions</h4>
        <p>
            Mukherjee specialized in differential geometry and elliptic functions. His doctoral thesis explored the intricate
            properties of <b>elliptic functions</b>, an area connected deeply with complex analysis and number theory. One of
            the classical relations in this field is Jacobi’s identity:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[
            \mathrm{sn}^2(u, k) + \mathrm{cn}^2(u, k) = 1, \quad
            \mathrm{dn}^2(u, k) + k^2 \mathrm{sn}^2(u, k) = 1
            \]
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here, <i>sn</i>, <i>cn</i>, and <i>dn</i> are <b>Jacobi elliptic functions</b>, and \(k\) is the elliptic modulus.
            Mukherjee’s research and teaching helped advance the understanding of these sophisticated concepts in India, making
            them accessible to scholars who might otherwise have been excluded from such advanced studies during the colonial
            era.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Educational Leadership</h4>
        <p>
            As Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta for five terms (1906–1923), Mukherjee transformed the institution
            from a mere examination body into a modern research university. He introduced postgraduate programs in science and
            mathematics, fostered original research, and invited leading scholars from around the world to India.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Legacy and Impact</h4>
        <p>
            Mukherjee had an exceptional eye for talent. He discovered and supported <b>Srinivasa Ramanujan</b>, ensuring that
            his mathematical genius gained recognition, and provided opportunities to <b>C. V. Raman</b>, who later won the
            Nobel Prize in Physics. He also founded the <b>Calcutta Mathematical Society</b> in 1908, fostering an intellectual
            environment that nurtured future generations of mathematicians and scientists in India.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Honors and Personality</h4>
        <p>
            Knighted in 1911 for his services to education, Ashutosh Mukherjee was nevertheless unafraid to challenge colonial
            authorities in defense of academic freedom. His fierce independence and dedication earned him the affectionate title
            “Banglar Bagh” (Tiger of Bengal).
        </p>
        
        <h4>Enduring Influence</h4>
        <p>
            Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee passed away on May 25, 1924, but his legacy lives on in the institutions he built and the
            lives he transformed. By combining mathematical brilliance with administrative acumen, he demonstrated that
            scholarship, courage, and vision could reshape not only academia but also the intellectual future of a nation.
