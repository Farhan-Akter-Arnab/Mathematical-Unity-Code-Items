        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee</h3>
        <h4>The Tiger of Bengal and Architect of Modern Education in India</h4>
        <p>
            Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee (1864 – 1924), widely known as the “Tiger of Bengal,” was a polymath, mathematician,
            jurist,
            and visionary educationist. Born on June 29, 1864, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, he demonstrated
            brilliance
            early in life. He studied mathematics at Presidency College, Calcutta, earning dual degrees in mathematics
            and
            physics, and completed a doctorate in mathematics in 1887. Later, he pursued law and became a successful
            barrister,
            yet his passion for mathematics and education never waned.

        <h4>Mathematical Contributions</h4>
        <p>
            Mukherjee specialized in differential geometry and elliptic functions. His doctoral thesis explored the
            intricate
            properties of <b>elliptic functions</b>, an area connected deeply with complex analysis and number theory.
            One of
            the classical relations in this field is Jacobi’s identity:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[
            \mathrm{sn}^2(u, k) + \mathrm{cn}^2(u, k) = 1, \quad
            \mathrm{dn}^2(u, k) + k^2 \mathrm{sn}^2(u, k) = 1
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, <i>sn</i>, <i>cn</i>, and <i>dn</i> are <b>Jacobi elliptic functions</b>, and \(k\) is the elliptic
            modulus.
            Mukherjee’s research and teaching helped advance the understanding of these sophisticated concepts in India,
            making
            them accessible to scholars who might otherwise have been excluded from such advanced studies during the
            colonial
            era.
        </p>

        <h4>Educational Leadership</h4>
        <p>
            As Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta for five terms (1906–1923), Mukherjee transformed the
            institution
            from a mere examination body into a modern research university. He introduced postgraduate programs in
            science and
            mathematics, fostered original research, and invited leading scholars from around the world to India.
        </p>

        <h4>Legacy and Impact</h4>
        <p>
            Mukherjee had an exceptional eye for talent. He discovered and supported <b>Srinivasa Ramanujan</b>,
            ensuring that
            his mathematical genius gained recognition, and provided opportunities to <b>C. V. Raman</b>, who later won
            the
            Nobel Prize in Physics. He also founded the <b>Calcutta Mathematical Society</b> in 1908, fostering an
            intellectual
            environment that nurtured future generations of mathematicians and scientists in India.
        </p>

        <h4>Honors and Personality</h4>
        <p>
            Knighted in 1911 for his services to education, Ashutosh Mukherjee was nevertheless unafraid to challenge
            colonial
            authorities in defense of academic freedom. His fierce independence and dedication earned him the
            affectionate title
            “Banglar Bagh” (Tiger of Bengal).
        </p>

        <h4>Enduring Influence</h4>
        <p>
            Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee passed away on May 25, 1924, but his legacy lives on in the institutions he built and
            the
            lives he transformed. By combining mathematical brilliance with administrative acumen, he demonstrated that
            scholarship, courage, and vision could reshape not only academia but also the intellectual future of a
            nation.
