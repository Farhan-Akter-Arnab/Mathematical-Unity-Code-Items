        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Anaxagoras</h3>
        <h4>Pre-Socratic Greek Philosopher (c. 500 BCE – c. 428 BCE)</h4>
        <p>Anaxagoras was a philosopher from Clazomenae, a city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). He is best known for
            introducing philosophical and scientific thinking to Athens and for proposing radical ideas about the nature
            of
            matter, the mind, and celestial bodies. Living during a time when mythology dominated people's understanding
            of the
            world, he sought to explain natural phenomena using reason and observation.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Everything Contains a Part of Everything</h4>
        <p>One of Anaxagoras' most famous ideas was that everything is made up of infinitely small particles, and that
            every
            object contains parts of everything else.</p>
        <p>He believed that nothing comes from nothing and nothing disappears into nothing. Instead, things are formed
            by the
            mixing and separation of tiny ingredients he called “seeds” or “nous.”</p>
        <p>For example, he claimed that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water contains elements of fire, earth, air, and other substances.</li>
            <li>Flesh, bone, hair, and blood all contain parts of each other — the differences arise from which
                ingredient is
                dominant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This was a very early version of what we might now call the theory of matter — long before atoms were
            discovered.</p>

        <h4>The Role of Nous (Mind)</h4>
        <p>Anaxagoras was one of the first to introduce the concept of <em>Nous</em>, Greek for "Mind" or "Intellect."
            He said
            that <em>Nous</em> is a universal and infinite force that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initiates motion in the universe</li>
            <li>Organizes chaos into order</li>
            <li>Is separate from matter, but controls it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This was revolutionary because earlier thinkers believed natural processes were random or based on gods.
            Anaxagoras
            suggested instead that a rational force (<em>Nous</em>) arranged the universe.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"All things were together; then Mind came and arranged them."</p>
            <footer>Anaxagoras (paraphrased)</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Astronomy and the Nature of Celestial Bodies</h4>
        <p>Anaxagoras studied the Sun, Moon, and stars, and offered scientific explanations for celestial phenomena,
            challenging
            traditional religious beliefs.</p>
        <p>Key ideas include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Sun is a red-hot stone, not a god.</li>
            <li>The Moon reflects sunlight and has mountains and valleys.</li>
            <li>Eclipses occur when the Moon passes in front of the Sun (solar eclipse) or enters the Earth's shadow
                (lunar
                eclipse).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He was among the first to correctly explain that the Moon’s light is reflected sunlight, not its own light.
        </p>
        <p>He also believed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The stars were fiery stones far away from the Earth.</li>
            <li>The Earth was flat and floated on air.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even though some of his views were incorrect by modern standards, his method of relying on natural causes and
            reasoning was a big step forward.</p>

        <h4>Meteorite and Natural Phenomena</h4>
        <p>A meteorite famously fell in Aegospotami (in Thrace) during Anaxagoras’ lifetime, which he predicted. He used
            this
            event to support his idea that celestial bodies were not divine but made of stone and subject to natural
            laws.</p>
        <p>He also studied natural phenomena such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rainbows</li>
            <li>Halos</li>
            <li>Comets</li>
            <li>Wind and weather patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>His explanations were not always accurate, but he consistently sought natural causes rather than myths or
            gods.</p>

        <h4>Conflict and Legacy</h4>
        <p>Because of his radical ideas — especially denying the divinity of the Sun — Anaxagoras was charged with
            impiety and
            imprisoned in Athens. He was later exiled, likely due to political pressure.</p>
        <p>Despite this, his ideas strongly influenced later thinkers such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Socrates</li>
            <li>Plato</li>
            <li>Aristotle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anaxagoras is often credited as one of the first philosophers to apply scientific thinking to the universe.
            His
            legacy lies in his bold use of reason, logic, and natural explanations in an age dominated by mythology.</p>
