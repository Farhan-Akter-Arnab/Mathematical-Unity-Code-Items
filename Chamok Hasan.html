            <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
            <h3>Chamok Hasan</h3>
            <h4>Engineer, Educator, Musician, and Author</h4>
            <p><strong>Chamok Hasan</strong> (born July 28, 1986, Kushtia, Bangladesh) is a multifaceted Bangladeshi
                engineer,
                educator, musician, and author. He is widely recognized for his innovative approach to teaching
                mathematics
                and
                science, blending education with entertainment to engage learners of all ages.</p>
            <img src="Chamok Hasan.png" alt="Chamok Hasan" class="img-fluid"
                style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
            <h4>Early Life and Education</h4>
            <p> Chamok Hasan completed his undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering at the
                Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), an institution widely regarded for
                excellence in
                science
                and engineering education. During his time at BUET, he developed a strong command over mathematics,
                electromagnetics, and analytical problem-solving, which later became central to both his professional
                and
                educational pursuits. </p>
            <p> He went on to pursue a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of South Carolina, USA. His
                doctoral
                research focused on advanced topics in radio-frequency systems and electromagnetic theory, strengthening
                his
                expertise in areas that require deep mathematical modeling and precision. After completing his doctoral
                studies, he
                joined Boston Scientific Corporation as a Research and Development engineer, where he works on
                cutting-edge
                medical
                technologies. His research interests include MRI RF safety, electronically steerable antennas, and
                wideband
                metasurfaces—fields that combine applied mathematics, physics, and engineering design. </p>
            <h4>Contributions to Education and Music</h4>
            <p> Alongside his engineering career, Chamok Hasan is widely known for his contributions to mathematics and
                science
                education. He has gained significant recognition for presenting complex mathematical and scientific
                concepts
                in an
                engaging, accessible, and intuitive manner. His educational approach emphasizes conceptual clarity over
                rote
                memorization, helping learners build confidence and genuine understanding. </p>
            <p> A distinctive feature of his educational work is the integration of music with learning. Through
                original
                songs and
                creative performances, he conveys mathematical ideas, scientific principles, and problem-solving
                strategies
                in a way
                that is both memorable and enjoyable. This interdisciplinary method has made his content especially
                popular
                among
                students, teachers, and self-learners. </p>
            <h4>Publications</h4>
            <p> Chamok Hasan has authored multiple books in Bengali that focus on mathematics, science, and logical
                thinking. His
                writings are aimed at a broad audience, ranging from school students to general readers with an interest
                in
                understanding scientific ideas more deeply. Rather than functioning as conventional textbooks, his books
                emphasize
                intuition, curiosity, and real-world connections. </p>
            <p> One of his most well-known works is <em>“অঙ্ক ভাইয়া” (“Anko Vaiya”)</em>, which presents mathematical
                concepts in a
                friendly and relatable style. In addition to this title, he has written several other books that explore
                mathematics
                and science from a popular-education perspective, contributing significantly to science communication in
                the
                Bengali
                language. </p>
            <h4>Music Direction in Film</h4>
            <p> In 2022, Chamok Hasan expanded his creative endeavors by making his debut as a music director for the
                Indian
                Bengali-language drama film <em>“Baba Baby O”</em>. This milestone highlighted his versatility as both a
                technical
                professional and an artist. His involvement in film music reflects the same creativity and thoughtful
                expression
                that characterize his educational and musical works. </p>
            <h4>Personal Life</h4>
            <p> Chamok Hasan is married to Feroja Binte Omar and is the father of two children. Alongside his
                professional,
                educational, and artistic
                activities, he maintains a balanced family life. His role as a parent further informs his commitment to
                education
                and effective communication, particularly in making learning accessible and engaging for younger
                generations. </p>
            <h4>Online Presence</h4>
            <p> Chamok Hasan maintains an active and influential online presence, where he regularly shares educational
                videos,
                musical content, and reflections on learning, creativity, and scientific thinking. His digital platforms
