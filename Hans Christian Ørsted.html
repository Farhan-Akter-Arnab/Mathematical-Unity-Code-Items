        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Hans Christian Ørsted</h3>
        <h4>Pioneer Discoverer of Electromagnetism</h4>
        <p>Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851) was a Danish physicist and chemist, best known for discovering that
            electric
            currents generate magnetic fields — the phenomenon now known as Ørsted’s law. Born in Rudkøbing, Denmark,
            Ørsted
            played a leading role in the Danish Golden Age of science and thought.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Early Life and Education</h4>
        <p>Ørsted was born into an apothecary family and studied pharmacy under his father before pursuing higher
            education.
            With encouragement from private tutors and personal determination, he passed the entrance exam to the
            University of
            Copenhagen in 1793 and received his doctorate in 1799 with a dissertation on metaphysics inspired by Kantian
            philosophy
            ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted?utm_source=chatgpt.com),
            [biographs.org](https://biographs.org/hans-christian-oersted?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).</p>

        <h4>Professorship and Early Research</h4>
        <p>In 1806, Ørsted was appointed professor of physics at the University of Copenhagen, where he delivered
            popular
            lectures on electricity, acoustics, and philosophy. He experimented with Voltaic piles, inspired by
            Alessandro
            Volta's invention, and began to suspect that electricity and magnetism might be connected
            ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted?utm_source=chatgpt.com),
            [biographs.org](https://biographs.org/hans-christian-oersted?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).</p>

        <h4>Discovery of Electromagnetism</h4>
        <p>In April 1820, during a lecture demonstration, Ørsted observed that a compass needle deflected when placed
            near a
            wire carrying electric current. This event marked the first experimental evidence that electricity generates
            a
            magnetic field.</p>
        <p>He found that the magnetic field forms concentric circles around the wire, which can be described
            mathematically as:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">$$\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I$$</p>
        <p>This is the integral form of Ampère’s law (later formulated by André-Marie Ampère), where \(\mathbf{B}\) is
            the
            magnetic field, \(I\) is the current, and \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space
            ([nbi.ku.dk](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/www/hco/oersted/opdagelsen/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).</p>

        <h4>Impact and Influence</h4>
        <p>Ørsted's discovery sparked a rapid expansion of research in electromagnetism, inspiring scientists such as
            André-Marie Ampère, who developed mathematical formulations of magnetic forces, and Michael Faraday, who
            discovered
            electromagnetic induction. Faraday’s law is expressed as:</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">$$\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$</p>
        <p>where \(\mathcal{E}\) is the induced EMF and \(\Phi_B\) is the magnetic flux
            ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).</p>

        <h4>Chemistry and Popular Science</h4>
        <p>Ørsted’s scientific interests extended to chemistry. In 1820, he became the first to isolate piperine, the
            pungent
            compound in pepper, and in 1825 he discovered an early form of metallic aluminum
            ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Christian-Orsted?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).</p>
        <p>He also founded the Society for the Dissemination of Natural Science in 1824, promoting science education
            among the
            public. Since then, the H. C. Ørsted Medal has been awarded for outstanding scientific communication.</p>

        <h4>Later Career and Legacy</h4>
        <p>Ørsted held his professorship at Copenhagen until his death in 1851, while also contributing to the
            foundation of
            Denmark’s first polytechnic institute, now the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).</p>
        <p>His name endures in the unit of magnetic field strength in the CGS system — the oersted — and in Denmark’s
            first
            satellite, launched in 1999. He is also commemorated by statues, medals, and park names throughout
            Copenhagen.</p>

        <h4>Legacy in Science</h4>
        <p>Ørsted’s contributions marked the birth of electromagnetism as a unified scientific field, fundamentally
            changing how
            we understand and harness electricity and magnetism. His pioneering work paved the way for modern electrical
            engineering, telecommunications, and magnetic sensors, earning him a place among history's most influential
            physicists.</p>
