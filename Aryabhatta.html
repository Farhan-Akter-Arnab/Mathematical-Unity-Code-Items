        <h3>Aryabhata</h3>
        <h4>Aryabhata (476 CE – c. 550 CE)</h4>
        <p>
            Aryabhata was a pioneering Indian mathematician and astronomer born in 476 CE, traditionally believed to be
            from
            Kusumapura (modern Patna, Bihar, India). He is one of the earliest mathematicians whose works have survived
            and
            whose influence shaped the foundation of classical Indian mathematics and astronomy.

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Aryabhata authored the seminal work:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Aryabhatiya (499 CE)</b> — a comprehensive treatise combining mathematics and astronomy, composed in
                118
                verses, that remains a classic text influencing later scholars.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Life and Background</h4>
        <p>
            Very little is conclusively known about Aryabhata's early life. Some sources identify him as hailing from
            Kusumapura, capital of the ancient Magadha kingdom, a center of learning and culture. He lived during the
            Gupta
            period, a golden age for Indian arts and sciences.<br>
            Aryabhata is sometimes confused with other later astronomers of the same name, but his distinct
            contributions set
            him apart as one of the earliest innovators in Indian mathematical astronomy.
        </p>

        <h4>Mathematical Contributions</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>Place Value and Zero</dt>
            <dd>
                Aryabhata used a place-value decimal system, an advanced form of notation that laid the groundwork for
                the
                modern decimal system. While he did not explicitly use zero as a digit, his numeral system implied the
                concept
                of zero as a placeholder, which was elaborated by later mathematicians.
            </dd>
            <dt>Approximation of π</dt>
            <dd>
                Aryabhata gave an astonishingly accurate approximation of pi (π), stating it as:<br>
                \[\pi \approx 3.1416\]<br>
                He expressed it in terms of a circle’s circumference and diameter, estimating π correct to four decimal
                places,
                a remarkable achievement for the time.
            </dd>
            <dt>Trigonometry</dt>
            <dd>
                Aryabhata introduced the concepts of sine (jya), cosine, and versine in Indian mathematics. He presented
                the
                sine table for angles between 0° and 90° in increments of 3.75°, with values calculated using a radius
                of 3438
                (the number of minutes in a circle).<br>
                His trigonometric formulas and methods of interpolation paved the way for more precise astronomical
                calculations.
            </dd>
            <dt>Algebra and Arithmetic</dt>
            <dd>
                Aryabhata worked on solving linear and quadratic equations. He gave methods for summing arithmetic and
                geometric
                progressions and developed techniques for finding unknowns in indeterminate equations.
            </dd>

        <h4>Astronomical Contributions</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>Earth’s Rotation and Heliocentrism</dt>
            <dd>
                He correctly explained the Earth’s rotation on its axis, giving a heliocentric explanation for the
                apparent
                movement of the stars.
            </dd>
            <dt>Solar Year Calculation</dt>
            <dd>
                He provided calculations of the length of the solar year as 365.358 days, very close to the modern
                value.
            </dd>
            <dt>Eclipses</dt>
            <dd>
                His descriptions included solar and lunar eclipses, based on the shadows cast by and on the Earth.
            </dd>
            <dt>Earth and Celestial Measurements</dt>
            <dd>
                Aryabhata also estimated the diameter of the Earth and distances to the Moon and Sun with impressive
                accuracy
                for his era.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <hr>
        <h4>Aryabhatiya: The Masterpiece</h4>
        <p>
            The Aryabhatiya is divided into four sections:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Gitikapada</b> — Introduction with mathematical and astronomical fundamentals.</li>
            <li><b>Ganitapada</b> — Mathematics: arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and more.</li>
            <li><b>Kalakriyapada</b> — Time calculations, including planetary positions and eclipses.</li>
            <li><b>Golapada</b> — Sphere and celestial phenomena.</li>
        </ol>
        The work was written in concise verse form using a code system for numbers and concepts, designed for
        memorization and
        oral transmission.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Legacy and Influence</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>His treatises were studied and commented on by later scholars like Varahamihira, Bhaskara I, and
                Brahmagupta.
            </li>
            <li>Arab mathematicians and astronomers translated and incorporated his ideas during the Islamic Golden Age,
                helping
                to transmit Indian mathematical concepts to the West.</li>
            <li>Aryabhata’s legacy endures in modern Indian science and mathematics, with institutions and awards named
                in his
                honor.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
            Aryabhata stands as a monumental figure in the history of mathematics and astronomy:
        <ul>
            <li>Pioneer of place-value decimal system concepts.</li>
            <li>Provided the first accurate approximation of π.</li>
            <li>Explained Earth's rotation centuries before Copernicus.</li>
            <li>Made critical advances in trigonometry and algebra.</li>
            <li>Authored the Aryabhatiya, a foundational text still studied for its mathematical depth and elegance.
            </li>
        </ul>
