        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Thales of Miletus</h3>
        <h4>Ancient Greek Mathematician, Philosopher, and Astronomer</h4>
        <p>Thales of Miletus (c. 624 BCE – c. 546 BCE) is usually considered the first mathematician in history and a
            founder of
            Greek science and philosophy. Born in Miletus, an Ionian city in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey), Thales
            traveled
            widely, studying with Egyptian and Babylonian scholars. History indicates that he brought geometry to
            Greece, having
            learned from Egyptian surveyors' mathematical methods. Thales was also one of the Seven Sages of Greece,
            renowned
            for practical wisdom and an analytical mind. His work marked the beginning of scientific thought in place of
            mythological explanations. He redirected explanations of natural phenomena from mythic to deductive causes,
            establishing the groundwork for scientific thinking.</p>
        <img src="Thales.webp" alt="Thales" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Philosophy: Water as the Origin of Everything</h4>
        <p>Thales believed that everything in the universe originated from a single substance — and he proposed that
            substance
            was water.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water exists in three forms: solid (ice), liquid, and gas (vapor).</li>
            <li>All living things require water.</li>
            <li>Moisture is everywhere in nature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, he concluded that water was the essential element of all matter — a unifying principle behind all things.
            Although we now know water is not the fundamental substance of the universe, Thales’ thinking was
            revolutionary
            because he tried to explain nature using natural causes, not gods or myths.</p>

        <h4>“All Things Are Full of Gods”</h4>
        <p>Thales also believed that the universe was alive in a sense — that everything had a soul or divine force
            within it.
            When he said, “All things are full of gods,” he likely meant that nature itself has power and motion, not
            that
            literal deities live in everything. This view blended philosophy and early spiritual ideas and later
            influenced
            theories of motion and matter.</p>

        <h4>Astronomy and Predicting Eclipses</h4>
        <p>Thales studied the heavens and was one of the first to try and explain celestial events scientifically.
            According to
            ancient sources, he predicted a solar eclipse that occurred during a battle between the Medes and the
            Lydians in May
            28, 585 BCE — an event that stopped the war. Whether he truly predicted it or not, the fact that he sought a
            natural
            pattern in the skies made him a pioneer in astronomy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Earth is a flat disc floating on water.</li>
            <li>The Moon shines by reflecting the light of the Sun.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In astronomy, he astonished contemporaries by predicting a solar eclipse — a remarkable achievement for his
            era.
            Again, although not all his conclusions were correct, his method of reasoning and observation was
            groundbreaking for
            his time.</p>

        <h4>Work in Geometry</h4>
        <p>Thales brought mathematical knowledge from Egypt to Greece and laid the groundwork for Euclidean geometry. He
            is
            credited with several important geometric theorems and is believed to be the first person to use deductive
            reasoning
            in geometry. Thales was responsible for a number of significant geometrical discoveries, most famously
            Thales’
            Theorem, which holds that any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A circle is bisected by its diameter.</li>
            <li>Angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are equal.</li>
            <li>Opposite angles formed by two intersecting lines are equal.</li>
            <li>The angle in a semicircle is a right angle \((90^\circ)\).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He used geometry to solve real-world problems, such as calculating the height of pyramids by measuring
            shadows and
            the distance of ships offshore using similar triangles.</p>

        <h4>Legacy and Influence</h4>
        <p>Thales’ insistence on logical inference and abstract reasoning represents a significant shift from empirical
            methods
            to theoretical mathematics, shaping generations of thinkers, including other great mathematicians like
            Pythagoras
            and Euclid. He is remembered not just for what he discovered, but for how he thought — searching for natural
            principles and trying to explain the world using observation, logic, and deduction. This made him the first
            figure
            in the tradition of Western science and philosophy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anaximander (his student)</li>
            <li>Pythagoras</li>
            <li>Plato</li>
            <li>Aristotle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thales’ true importance lies in his belief that the universe is understandable — that humans can discover the
            truth
            about nature through reasoning rather than myth.</p>
