            <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
            <h3>Thales of Miletus</h3>
            <h4>Ancient Greek Mathematician, Philosopher, and Astronomer</h4>
            <p>Thales of Miletus (c. 624 BCE – c. 546 BCE) is usually considered the first mathematician in history and
                a
                founder of
                Greek science and philosophy. Born in Miletus, an Ionian city in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey), Thales
                traveled
                widely, studying with Egyptian and Babylonian scholars. History indicates that he brought geometry to
                Greece, having
                learned from Egyptian surveyors' mathematical methods. Thales was also one of the Seven Sages of Greece,
                renowned
                for practical wisdom and an analytical mind. His work marked the beginning of scientific thought in
                place of
                mythological explanations. He redirected explanations of natural phenomena from mythic to deductive
                causes,
                establishing the groundwork for scientific thinking.</p>
            <img src="Thales.webp" alt="Thales" class="img-fluid"
                style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
            <h4>Philosophy: Water as the Origin of Everything</h4>
            <p>Thales believed that everything in the universe originated from a single substance — and he proposed that
                substance
                was water.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Water exists in three forms: solid (ice), liquid, and gas (vapor).</li>
                <li>All living things require water.</li>
                <li>Moisture is everywhere in nature.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, he concluded that water was the essential element of all matter — a unifying principle behind all
                things.
                Although we now know water is not the fundamental substance of the universe, Thales’ thinking was
                revolutionary
                because he tried to explain nature using natural causes, not gods or myths.</p>

            <h4>“All Things Are Full of Gods”</h4>
            <p>Thales also believed that the universe was alive in a sense — that everything had a soul or divine force
                within it.
                When he said, “All things are full of gods,” he likely meant that nature itself has power and motion,
                not
                that
                literal deities live in everything. This view blended philosophy and early spiritual ideas and later
                influenced
                theories of motion and matter.</p>

            <h4>Astronomy and Predicting Eclipses</h4>
            <p>Thales studied the heavens and was one of the first to try and explain celestial events scientifically.
                According to
                ancient sources, he predicted a solar eclipse that occurred during a battle between the Medes and the
                Lydians in May
                28, 585 BCE — an event that stopped the war. Whether he truly predicted it or not, the fact that he
                sought a
                natural
                pattern in the skies made him a pioneer in astronomy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Earth is a flat disc floating on water.</li>
                <li>The Moon shines by reflecting the light of the Sun.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In astronomy, he astonished contemporaries by predicting a solar eclipse — a remarkable achievement for
                his
                era.
                Again, although not all his conclusions were correct, his method of reasoning and observation was
                groundbreaking for
                his time.</p>

            <h4>Work in Geometry</h4>
            <p>Thales brought mathematical knowledge from Egypt to Greece and laid the groundwork for Euclidean
                geometry. He
                is
                credited with several important geometric theorems and is believed to be the first person to use
                deductive
                reasoning
                in geometry. Thales was responsible for a number of significant geometrical discoveries, most famously
                Thales’
                Theorem, which holds that any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A circle is bisected by its diameter.</li>
                <li>Angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are equal.</li>
                <li>Opposite angles formed by two intersecting lines are equal.</li>
                <li>The angle in a semicircle is a right angle \((90^\circ)\).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>He used geometry to solve real-world problems, such as calculating the height of pyramids by measuring
                shadows and
                the distance of ships offshore using similar triangles.</p>

            <h4>Legacy and Influence</h4>
            <p>Thales’ insistence on logical inference and abstract reasoning represents a significant shift from
                empirical
                methods
                to theoretical mathematics, shaping generations of thinkers, including other great mathematicians like
                Pythagoras
                and Euclid. He is remembered not just for what he discovered, but for how he thought — searching for
                natural
                principles and trying to explain the world using observation, logic, and deduction. This made him the
                first
                figure
                in the tradition of Western science and philosophy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anaximander (his student)</li>
                <li>Pythagoras</li>
                <li>Plato</li>
                <li>Aristotle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thales’ true importance lies in his belief that the universe is understandable — that humans can discover
                the
                truth
                about nature through reasoning rather than myth.</p>
