        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Kiyoshi Itō</h3>
        <h4>Pioneer of Stochastic Calculus</h4>
        <p>Kiyoshi Itō (1915–2008) was a brilliant Japanese mathematician who transformed the landscape of probability
            theory
            and stochastic processes. Born in Hokusei, Mie Prefecture, Itō lived through a turbulent century, including
            World
            War II, yet produced groundbreaking work that fundamentally changed both pure and applied mathematics.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Early Life and Education</h4>
        <p>Itō began his academic journey at the University of Tokyo, studying under the influential mathematician Teiji
            Takagi.
            Although his early interests lay in algebra and number theory, his focus soon shifted to probability theory
            — then a
            relatively new and evolving field. Working during wartime Japan with minimal international contact, he
            quietly
            developed ideas that would later reshape mathematics.</p>

        <h4>Development of Itō Calculus</h4>
        <p>The central theme of Itō’s work was the modeling of random, continuous processes, such as the motion of
            particles
            suspended in fluid (<em>Brownian motion</em>). Traditional calculus could not fully describe these systems
            due to
            their inherent randomness. In response, Itō created a new framework — stochastic calculus — which introduced
            powerful tools such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Itō integral</li>
            <li>Itō’s lemma</li>
            <li>Methods for solving stochastic differential equations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These tools allowed randomness to be incorporated directly into differential equations, providing a rigorous
            mathematical framework for uncertainty.</p>

        <h4>Applications and Global Impact</h4>
        <p>Initially, Itō’s work was slow to gain recognition, especially outside Japan. However, in the 1960s and
            1970s,
            stochastic calculus found wide-ranging applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Underpinned the Black–Scholes model for options pricing and risk management
            </li>
            <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Described diffusion processes and quantum systems with uncertainty</li>
            <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Modeled population dynamics, genetic drift, and neural activity under random
                influences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The versatility and depth of Itō’s ideas made stochastic calculus a universal language for modeling
            uncertainty in
            many scientific disciplines.</p>

        <h4>Academic Career and Recognition</h4>
        <p>Itō spent much of his career at Kyoto University, where he taught, mentored, and inspired a new generation of
            Japanese mathematicians. Despite his global acclaim, he remained modest and soft-spoken. His achievements
            earned him
            numerous honors, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Imperial Prize of the Japan Academy</li>
            <li>Wolf Prize in Mathematics</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>Kiyoshi Itō’s work continues to shape modern mathematics and its applications in finance, physics, biology,
            and
            beyond. His creation of stochastic calculus provided the mathematical world with a precise and powerful
            toolset for
            addressing the challenges of randomness and uncertainty, ensuring his place as one of the great mathematical
            innovators of the 20th century.</p>
