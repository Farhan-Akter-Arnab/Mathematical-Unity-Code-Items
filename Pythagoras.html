        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Pythagoras</h3>
        <h4>Ancient Greek Philosopher, Mathematician, and Spiritual Leader (c. 570–495 BCE)</h4>
        <p>Pythagoras (c. 570–495 BCE) is best known for the Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental principle in mathematics
            relating the sides of a right triangle. However, he was also a significant philosopher and religious figure
            whose
            ideas profoundly influenced both mathematics and spirituality.</p>
        <img src="Pythagoras.webp" alt="Pythagoras" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>Pythagoras founded a religious movement known as the Pythagoreans, who followed strict rules including
            dietary
            restrictions and communal living. They believed in the transmigration of souls (reincarnation) and viewed
            numbers as
            the ultimate reality underlying all existence.</p>

        <h4>Philosophy and Beliefs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Numbers were seen as the essence of all things; everything could be understood through numerical
                relationships.
            </li>
            <li>The universe was thought to be structured harmonically, like musical intervals, reflecting mathematical
                order.
            </li>
            <li>The soul was immortal and passed through cycles of rebirth until it achieved purification.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Mathematical Contributions</h4>
        <p>Pythagoras and his followers contributed to mathematics beyond the famous theorem:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Pythagorean Theorem:</b> For a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of
                the
                squares of the other two sides, expressed as \[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\].</li>
            <li>Developed concepts of numerical ratios and proportions, essential to later geometry and music theory.
            </li>
            <li>Explored properties of numbers, including classifications such as even and odd, perfect numbers, and
                triangular
                numbers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Legacy and Influence</h4>
        <p>Pythagoras’ blending of mathematics, philosophy, and mysticism shaped the development of Western thought. His
            emphasis on numerical harmony influenced Plato, Aristotle, and later Neoplatonists. The Pythagorean approach
            set the
            stage for the rigorous study of mathematics as both a scientific and philosophical discipline.</p>

        <p>His work also inspired developments in musical theory, astronomy, and cosmology, emphasizing the
            interconnectedness
            of the universe through mathematical principles.</p>
