        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Al-Farabi</h3>
        <h4>Philosopher, Scientist, and Early Islamic Polymath</h4>
        <p>Al-Farabi (c. 872 – c. 950 CE), also known as Abu Nasr Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Farabi, was a renowned
            philosopher,
            scientist, logician, and musician of the Islamic Golden Age. Born in Farab (in present-day Kazakhstan or
            Turkmenistan), he later worked in Baghdad and other cultural centers of the Abbasid Caliphate. He was
            instrumental
            in preserving and developing the works of Aristotle and Plato, earning him the title “The Second Teacher”
            (after
            Aristotle) in Islamic intellectual tradition.</p>
        <img src="Al-Farabi.jpeg" alt="Al-Farabi" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>While Al-Farabi is most celebrated for his philosophical works, he also made important contributions to
            mathematics,
            logic, and the scientific methodology. He wrote extensively on logic, systematically organizing the
            Aristotelian
            corpus, and integrating it with Islamic thought. His treatises on syllogisms and deduction were foundational
            to
            later developments in both Islamic and Western logic.</p>

        <p>In mathematics, Al-Farabi emphasized the application of logic to mathematical proof and reasoning. While not
            a
            mathematician in the computational sense like Al-Khwarizmi or Al-Kindi, he contributed to the classification
            of
            sciences and mathematics as a structured discipline. He discussed the nature of numbers, quantities, and
            mathematical objects in philosophical terms, bridging abstract reasoning with practical science.</p>

        <p>Al-Farabi also studied musical theory and wrote <i>Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir</i> (The Great Book of Music),
            where he
            mathematically analyzed scales and intervals, relating them to ratios — a practice inherited from the Greek
            Pythagorean tradition. This work contributed to both the science of acoustics and the aesthetics of music in
            the
            Islamic world.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Preserved and expanded Aristotelian logic in the Islamic tradition</li>
            <li>Developed philosophical foundations of science and mathematics</li>
            <li>Wrote influential works on music theory using mathematical principles</li>
            <li>Classified branches of knowledge and influenced both Islamic and Western scholars</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Al-Farabi's influence extended through centuries, impacting later Islamic thinkers such as Avicenna (Ibn
            Sina) and
            even reaching medieval Europe via Latin translations. His holistic approach to knowledge, unifying
            philosophy,
            logic, science, and music, marked him as one of the most important intellectual figures of the early Islamic
            era.
