        <h3>Meton of Athens</h3>
        <h4>The Father of the Metonic Cycle</h4>
        <p>
            Meton of Athens (fl. 5th century BCE, around 432 BCE) was a Greek astronomer, mathematician, engineer, and surveyor.
            He is best remembered for introducing the <b>Metonic cycle</b>, a 19-year period that reconciles the solar year with
            the lunar month. This discovery became a cornerstone of ancient calendars and is still relevant in modern
            timekeeping.
        </p>
        <img src="Meton.jpg" alt="Meton of Athens" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Meton lived in Athens during the classical period and worked alongside his colleague <b>Euctemon</b>. He observed
            the heavens from the Pnyx Hill in Athens, where a solar observatory (<i>Heliopolis</i>) was established to make
            precise astronomical measurements.
        </p>
        <p>
            His work focused on understanding the relationship between the solar year \((365.24\ \text{days})\) and the lunar
            month \((29.53\ \text{days})\), which was essential for building accurate calendars used in festivals, agriculture,
            and religious life.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>(a) The Metonic Cycle</b><br>
                Meton discovered that:
                <br>
                \[
                19\ \text{solar years} \approx 235\ \text{lunar months}
                \]
                <p>Mathematically:</p>
                \[
                19 \times 365.24 \approx 6939.6\ \text{days}
                \]
                \[
                235 \times 29.53 \approx 6939.7\ \text{days}
                \]
                <p>
                    The two values are almost equal, differing by only a few hours. This allowed him to align lunar and solar
                    calendars, making it possible to predict eclipses and set consistent dates for festivals.
                </p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <b>(b) The Callippic Cycle</b><br>
                Later, his cycle was refined by <b>Callippus</b>, who combined four Metonic cycles (76 years) and corrected the
                small discrepancy. This refinement highlighted how influential Meton’s work was in shaping future Greek
                astronomy.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <b>(c) Calendar Reform</b><br>
                Meton proposed reforms to the Attic calendar of Athens, inserting “intercalary months” based on his cycle to
                keep lunar months in sync with the solar year. His reforms influenced not only Greek but also Jewish and
                Babylonian calendars.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Influence and Legacy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>In Antiquity:</b> The Metonic cycle was inscribed on the <b>Antikythera Mechanism</b>, the ancient Greek
                “astronomical computer.”
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>In the Jewish Calendar:</b> The Hebrew calendar still uses the Metonic cycle to fix the dates of Passover and
                other festivals.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>In Christianity:</b> The cycle plays a key role in determining the date of Easter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>In Astronomy:</b> His work demonstrated the power of mathematical cycles to track celestial phenomena long
                before modern astronomy.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>
            Meton of Athens is remembered as the master calendar-maker of antiquity. His 19-year cycle provided a practical
            solution to harmonizing the Sun, Moon, and Earth’s rhythms, ensuring that human rituals and agriculture stayed in
            step with the heavens.
