        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Max Planck</h3>
        <h4>Father of Quantum Theory</h4>
        <p>Max Planck (1858–1947) was a German theoretical physicist who originated quantum theory, fundamentally
            transforming
            our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. Born in Kiel, Germany, Planck showed early promise in
            mathematics and physics, eventually studying at the University of Munich and the University of Berlin under
            Hermann
            von Helmholtz and others.</p>

        <h4>Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe</h4>
        <p>In the late 19th century, classical physics could not explain the spectrum of light emitted by a heated
            object
            (blackbody radiation), particularly at short wavelengths — a problem known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.
            Planck
            solved this problem by proposing that energy is quantized, emitted, or absorbed in discrete units called
            <em>quanta</em>.
        </p>
        <p>He introduced the fundamental relation:</p>
        \[
        E = h \nu
        \]
        <p>Where \( E \) is the energy of a quantum, \( \nu \) is the frequency of radiation, and \( h \) is Planck’s
            constant
            (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).</p>

        <h4>Planck’s Radiation Law</h4>
        <p>Planck derived a formula describing the intensity of radiation from a blackbody at temperature \( T \):</p>
        \[
        B(\nu, T) = \frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_B T} - 1}
        \]
        <p>Where \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( k_B \) is Boltzmann’s constant. This law agreed perfectly with
            experimental data and laid the groundwork for quantum mechanics.</p>

        <h4>Quantum Theory</h4>
        <p>Planck’s radical idea — that energy is quantized — challenged classical physics, but it became the
            cornerstone of
            quantum theory. He did not initially understand the full implications, but his work paved the way for
            Einstein,
            Bohr, Heisenberg, and Schrödinger to develop modern quantum mechanics.</p>

        <h4>Later Work and Legacy</h4>
        <p>Planck also made contributions to thermodynamics, particularly the second law, and was an influential teacher
            and
            mentor to many future physicists. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 for his work on blackbody
            radiation.</p>
        <p>Max Planck’s introduction of quantization changed the course of physics forever, marking the transition from
            classical to modern physics and influencing virtually every branch of 20th-century science.</p>
