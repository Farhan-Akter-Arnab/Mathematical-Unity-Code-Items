        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Ali Nesin</h3>
        <h4>Turkish Mathematician and Educator</h4>
        <p>Ali Nesin (born 18 November 1956 in Istanbul, Turkey) is a Turkish mathematician renowned for his
            contributions to
            mathematical education and public outreach. He is the founder of the Nesin Mathematics Village, an
            innovative
            educational center dedicated to fostering a love for mathematics among people of all ages and backgrounds.

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Early Life and Education</h4>
        <p>Ali Nesin is the son of Aziz Nesin, a prominent Turkish writer and humorist. He completed his primary
            education at
            Lycée Saint-Joseph in Istanbul and his secondary education at Collège Champittet in Switzerland. He earned
            his
            Maîtrise ès arts degree in mathematics from Paris Diderot University in 1981 and obtained a doctorate in
            mathematical logic and algebra from Yale University in 1985.</p>

        <h4>Academic Career</h4>
        <p>Following his doctoral studies, Nesin held academic positions at several prestigious institutions, including
            the
            University of California, Berkeley, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of California, Irvine.
            In
            1993–1994, he served as a visiting lecturer at Bilkent University in Turkey. In 1995, upon the death of his
            father,
            he returned to Turkey and became the leader of the Nesin Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to
            providing educational opportunities for underprivileged children.</p>

        <h4>Nesin Mathematics Village</h4>
        <p>In 2007, Ali Nesin founded the Nesin Mathematics Village in Şirince, Turkey, aiming to create a peaceful and
            inspiring environment for the study and exploration of mathematics. The village offers summer courses and
            workshops
            for students ranging from high school to graduate levels, taught by volunteers from around the world. The
            initiative
            has become a model for mathematical education and outreach in Turkey and beyond.</p>

        <h4>Leelavati Prize</h4>
        <p>In recognition of his outstanding efforts to promote mathematics and establish the Nesin Mathematics Village,
            Ali
            Nesin was awarded the 2018 Leelavati Prize by the International Mathematical Union. The Leelavati Prize
            honors
            individuals who have made significant contributions to increasing public awareness of mathematics as an
            intellectual
            discipline and its role in human endeavors.</p>

        <h4>Publications and Contributions</h4>
        <p>Ali Nesin has authored several popular mathematics books, including <em>Mathematics and Fear</em>,
            <em>Mathematics
                and Nature</em>, and <em>Mathematics and Infinity</em>, aimed at making mathematics accessible to a
            broader
            audience. He has also written semi-academic texts on topics such as propositional logic, counting, and naive
            set
            theory. In addition to his written works, he has translated and published his father's correspondence and
            other
            writings.
        </p>

        <h4>Personal Life</h4>
        <p>Ali Nesin is married to Özlem Beyarslan and has four children. He is fluent in Turkish, French, English, and
            has some
            proficiency in Italian. In addition to his work in mathematics, he is an accomplished artist, engaging in
            oil
            painting, drawing, and portraiture. He is also a founding member of the Turkish Human Rights Institution
            Foundation
