        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Nilakantha Somayaji</h3>
        <h4>Kerala School Astronomer, Mathematician, and Pioneer of Quasi-Heliocentric Models</h4>
        <p>Nilakantha Somayaji (1444 – 1544 CE) was a distinguished figure in Indian mathematics and astronomy,
            renowned for advancing the legacy of Mādhava and shaping the intellectual foundations of the Kerala
            School of Mathematics and Astronomy. Born in Trikkandiyur in present-day Kerala, India, he belonged to
            the Nambudiri Brahmin lineage, and the title “Somayaji” signifies one who performed the prestigious
            Vedic Soma sacrifice. His lifetime of scholarship synthesized observation, computation, and Vedic tradition,
            producing works that anticipated concepts of modern astronomy and calculus.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>His magnum opus, the <i>Tantra Samgraha</i> (c. 1501 CE), is a comprehensive treatise covering
            planetary theory, eclipses, celestial motion, and trigonometry. In it, he proposed a
            <b>quasi-heliocentric model</b> in which Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn revolve around the
            Sun, which in turn revolves around the Earth—an idea that anticipated Copernican insights by decades
            while preserving geocentric elements.
        </p>

        <p>Nilakantha extended <b>Mādhava’s infinite series</b> methods, refined trigonometric tables with higher
            precision, and made early contributions to the understanding of derivatives and rates of change in
            astronomical contexts. His corrections for planetary motion involved ideas conceptually similar to
            modern Taylor series expansions. He also developed practical tools such as <i>Chandra Vākya</i> (Moon
            sentences) and <i>Gola</i> (spherical astronomy) for astronomical calculations, which were used by
            Kerala scholars for centuries.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Authored <i>Tantra Samgraha</i>, a foundational work in Indian astronomy</li>
            <li>Proposed a quasi-heliocentric planetary model decades before Copernicus</li>
            <li>Extended infinite series and refined trigonometric tables</li>
            <li>Applied early concepts of derivatives to planetary motion</li>
            <li>Developed practical computation techniques like Chandra Vākya and Gola</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Nilakantha’s other significant texts include the <i>Aryabhatiya Bhashya</i>, a commentary on Aryabhata
            integrating Mādhava’s insights, and the <i>Golasāra</i> on spherical astronomy. His meticulous
            observation, rigorous logic, and mathematical innovation influenced later Kerala scholars such as
            Jyesthadeva and Achyuta Pisharati, leaving a legacy that bridged the worlds of traditional Sanskrit
            scholarship and pioneering scientific thought.</p>
