        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Eratosthenes</h3>
        <h4>Ancient Greek Mathematician, Geographer, Astronomer, and Poet (c. 276 BCE – 194 BCE)</h4>
        <p>Eratosthenes was born in Cyrene, a city in modern-day Libya, and later became the chief librarian at the
            Library of
            Alexandria in Egypt — one of the most important centers of knowledge in the ancient world. He made many
            contributions to science, but is most famous for being the first person to calculate the circumference of
            the Earth
            with surprising accuracy.</p>
        <img src="Eratosthenes.jpg" alt="Eratosthenes" class="img-fluid"

        <h4>Measuring the Earth’s Circumference</h4>
        <p>Eratosthenes had heard that at noon on the summer solstice in the Egyptian city of Syene (now Aswan), the Sun
            was
            directly overhead, and vertical objects cast no shadow. However, at the same time in Alexandria (north of
            Syene),
            vertical objects did cast a shadow.</p>
        <p>He measured the angle of the shadow in Alexandria and found it to be about 7.2 degrees — or \(\frac{1}{50}\)
            of a
            full circle (360 degrees). Knowing the distance between Syene and Alexandria was approximately 5,000 stadia
            (about
            800 kilometers), he used simple geometry to estimate the Earth’s total circumference.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong><br>
            \[
            \text{Circumference} = \text{Distance} \times \left(\frac{360}{\text{Angle}}\right)
            \]</p>
        <p><strong>Substituting values:</strong><br>
            \[
            \text{Circumference} = 5,000 \times \left(\frac{360}{7.2}\right) = 5,000 \times 50 = 250,000 \text{ stadia}
            \]</p>
        <p>Depending on the length of a stadion (estimates vary), this corresponds roughly to 39,000 to 46,000
            kilometers —
            incredibly close to the modern value of about 40,075 kilometers.</p>
        <p>This was a brilliant achievement using only shadows, geometry, and logical reasoning.</p>

        <h4>Invention of Geography</h4>
        <p>Eratosthenes is often called the “Father of Geography.” He was the first to use the word “geography” and
            created one
            of the earliest maps of the known world using a grid system of latitude and longitude.</p>
        <p>He also divided the Earth into five climate zones:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two frigid zones (north and south)</li>
            <li>Two temperate zones</li>
            <li>One torrid zone around the equator</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He helped organize global geography and attempted to measure the sizes of continents and the distances
            between them.
        </p>

        <h4>Sieve of Eratosthenes</h4>
        <p>Eratosthenes contributed to mathematics with his famous algorithm to find prime numbers, called the “Sieve of
            Eratosthenes.”</p>
        <p>It works as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write down all numbers from 2 to some maximum number.</li>
            <li>Eliminate all multiples of 2, then multiples of 3, then multiples of 5, and so on.</li>
            <li>The remaining numbers that have not been eliminated are all prime numbers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This method is still taught in schools today and is one of the earliest examples of an algorithm.</p>

        <h4>Other Contributions</h4>
        <p>Eratosthenes attempted to calculate the distances to the Sun and Moon, though his results were not accurate
            due to
            limitations of the tools available. He also worked on calendar reform and tried to improve the leap year
            system.</p>
        <p>Known as a polymath — a person skilled in many fields — Eratosthenes was respected for his wide-ranging
            knowledge.
            Despite being nicknamed “Beta” (meaning second-best in everything) by some critics, he is remembered as a
            genius who
            used logical thinking to understand the size and shape of the Earth thousands of years before modern
            science.</p>

        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>Eratosthenes’ work in measuring the Earth changed how people saw the world. He proved that the Earth was
            round and
            measurable using simple tools. His mapping system and geographical thinking helped build the foundation of
            cartography and Earth sciences.</p>
