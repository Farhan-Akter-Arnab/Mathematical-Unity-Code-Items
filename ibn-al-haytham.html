        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3 id="3">Ibn al-Haytham, Mathematician who was a Vizier</h3>
        <p>At first, it should be cleared what a Vizier actually is. Vizier is the English and Turkish form of the
            Arabic word
            Wazir, meaning 'Minister'. 'Wazir' was the title for the ministers of Muslim kings, Sultans or Caliphs. Yes,
            you
            read that right, once a mathematician was truly appointed as a Vizier. He was Hasan ibn-al-Haytham. He was a
            mathematician, physicist and an astronomer at the same time during the Islamic Golden Age. He was also an
            influential polymath. He is popularly known as <abbr title="Latin form of his name">'Alhazen'</abbr> to the
            Western
            world. He was born in <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 965 in Basra of Buyid Emirate, and died in 1040 in Cairo
            of
            Fatimid Caliphate.</p>
        <img src="Ibn al-Haytham.jpeg" style="float: right; height: 250px;">
        <p>Referred to as "the father of modern optics", he made significant contributions to the principles of optics
            and
            visual perception in particular. His most influential work is titled Kitāb al-Manāẓir (Arabic: كتاب المناظر,
            "Book
            of Optics"), written during 1011–1021, which survived in a Latin edition. He succesfully proved that the
            light
            actually gets reflected from the object to the eyes so that we can see, contradictory to the <abbr
                title="Earlier scientists thought that the light from the eyes falls on to the object to help us see. It might sound weird, but people actually believed like this.">popular
                belief</abbr>. His discovery led to the invention of various optical instruments, including glasses that
            the eye
            patients need to wear, camera which helps us to take pictures, and so on.</p>
        <p>He was also the first to demonstrate the most acceptable <code>Scientific Method</code>. He mainly focused on
            finding
            and investigating the true essence of Science and everything rather than just to rely on the existing books
            and
            popular beliefs. He emphasized us to attack the sources by doing experiments. He said:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following
                his
                natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and
                questions
                what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of
                a human
                being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. The duty of the man who
                investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy
                of all
                that he reads, and ... attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his
                critical
                examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>He also made various contributions to astronomy, including the description of the Earth, and comments on the
            views of
            Ptolemy. He commented on Ptolemy's works which say that there is no arrangement of the planets. He said that
            indeed
            there is a certain arrangement of the planets, but it stays unknown and invisible to human beings. He worked
            on the
            model of the motions of each of the seven planets.</p>
        <p>His contributions to <code>Mathematics</code> is incredible. He was the first to work on the 'link between
            <code>Algebra</code> and <code>Geometry</code>'. He made the formula for the summation of first 100 natural
            numbers,
            and proved it using geometry. He attempted to solve the impossible construction of <abbr
                title="Which has been later proved to be truly IMPOSSIBLE"><code>"Squaring the Circle"</code></abbr>,
            but later
            gave up on this impossible task. He also worked on the lunes constructed on the two legs other than the
            hypotenuse
            of a right-angled triangle, which have an equal area of the triangle itself.
        </p>
        <p>He also worked on perfect numbers, and perhaps he was the first to state that every even perfect number was
            in the
            form of 2<sup>n-1</sup>(2<sup>n</sup>-1), where n must be a prime number. However, he could not prove his
            result,
            but later in the 18th century, Leonhard Euler was able to prove it.</p>
        <p>He also worked for engineering, philosophy, and most importantly, Islam. He worked on finding Qibla for Salat
            in a
            mathematical way. He believed that our Iman must be towards the Nabi-Rasuls to whom which Allah Ta'ala
            granted them
            Nabuwat, and not towards any ancient Hellenistic nobles.</p>
        <p>Ibn al-Haytham's initial influences were in the study of religion and service to the community. At the time,
            society
            had a number of conflicting views of religion that he ultimately sought to step aside from religion. This
            led to him
            delving into the study of mathematics and science. He held a position with the title of vizier in his native
            Basra
            of the Buyid Emirate, and became famous for his knowledge of applied mathematics, as evidenced by his
            attempt to
            regulate the flooding of the Nile. But after he proved unable to fulfill this task, he had to restrict
            himself from
            the Caliph of Egypt. Legend describes that Ibn al-Haytham feigned madness and kept under house arrest for
            this.
            During this time, he could accurately give the Scientific explanations in 'The Book of Optics'.</p>
