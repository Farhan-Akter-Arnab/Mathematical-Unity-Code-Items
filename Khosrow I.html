        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Khosrow I Anushirvan</h3>
        <h4>Sassanian Persian King and Patron of Science</h4>
        <p>
            Khosrow I Anushirvan (reigned 531–579 CE) was a Sassanian Persian king renowned not only for his political
            reforms
            but also for his patronage of science, philosophy, and mathematics. While not a scientist himself, his reign
            marked
            a golden era of intellectual exchange between Greek, Indian, and Persian traditions.
        </p>
        <img src="Khosrow I.webp" alt="Khosrow I" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Khosrow established the Academy of Gondeshapur as a major center of learning, where scholars translated
            Greek and
            Syriac scientific texts into Middle Persian. The academy became a repository of medical, astronomical, and
            mathematical knowledge, serving as a bridge between the classical world and the Islamic Golden Age.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under Khosrow’s patronage, Indian mathematical astronomy—particularly texts like the <i>Surya
                Siddhanta</i>—was
            introduced to Persia and eventually to the Arab world. Greek works of Aristotle, Galen, and Euclid were also
            translated and studied. By fostering this synthesis, Khosrow played a crucial role in transmitting
            mathematical
            astronomy and natural philosophy across cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Khosrow himself is remembered as a philosopher-king, often associated with wisdom and justice. His court
            welcomed
            philosophers fleeing the closure of the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens in 529 CE by Justinian. This migration
            brought
            late Platonic mathematical and metaphysical ideas into Persia, enriching intellectual debates at
            Gondeshapur.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though Khosrow was not an author of scientific works, his political vision created conditions for systematic
            knowledge transfer. His reign ensured the survival of Greco-Roman science, the introduction of Indian
            mathematics,
            and their eventual integration into Islamic scholarship. Thus, Khosrow I stands as an essential figure in
            the chain
            of transmission that preserved and expanded mathematical and scientific traditions beyond antiquity.
