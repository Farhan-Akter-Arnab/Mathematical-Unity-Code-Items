        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Nam Pyong-gil</h3>
        <h4>Pioneer of Modern Korean Mathematics</h4>
        <p>
            Nam Pyong-gil (1820–1869) was a Korean mathematician of the late Joseon Dynasty who played a pivotal role in
            bridging traditional East Asian mathematics with modern approaches influenced by the West. Born into a
            scholarly
            family, Nam mastered classical Korean and Chinese mathematical texts, such as the <i>Jiuzhang Suanshu</i>,
            but also
            engaged with new ideas entering East Asia through translations of Western works.
        </p>
        <p>
            He authored several influential books, including <i>Sanhak Jeongui</i> (“Correct Principles of
            Mathematics”), which
            systematized arithmetic, algebra, and geometry in a clear, logical manner. Nam focused on both practical and
            theoretical mathematics—covering land measurement, astronomical calculations, and proportions. His reformist
            approach attempted to modernize education by introducing rational explanations and deductive reasoning
            rather than
            rote methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nam was especially concerned with algebraic structures and numerical methods. He explored solutions to
            quadratic
            equations of the form
            \
            and provided simplified algorithms for root extraction and higher powers. He also promoted positional number
            systems, bringing clarity to arithmetic operations and advancing beyond older counting-rod methods. His
            efforts
            aligned Korea more closely with global mathematics while still preserving elements of East Asian traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although he lived during a time of political upheaval and isolation, Nam’s work laid intellectual
            foundations for
            the modernization of mathematics in Korea. His writings became reference texts for later reformers and
            helped ensure
            that Korean mathematics would transition into the modern scientific age. He is remembered today as a key
            figure who
            bridged classical scholarship with emerging global science.
