        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Plato (c. 428–348 BCE)</h3>
        <h4>Greek Philosopher, Founder of the Academy, and Teacher of Aristotle</h4>
        <p>Plato (c. 428–348 BCE) Plato was a student of Socrates and the teacher of Aristotle. He founded the Academy
            in
            Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. His most famous works include The
            Republic,
            where he outlines his ideas on justice and ideal government. Plato believed in the world of Forms—perfect,
            unchanging ideas that exist beyond the physical world.</p>
        <img src="Plato.jpg" alt="Plato" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Major Works and Dialogues</h4>
        <p>Plato wrote most of his philosophy in the form of dialogues, where characters (often Socrates) explore
            philosophical
            questions through conversation. Key works include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>The Republic</em> — political philosophy, justice, the philosopher-king, and the tripartite soul.
            </li>
            <li><em>Phaedo</em> — on the immortality of the soul and Socrates’ final arguments.</li>
            <li><em>Symposium</em> — discussions on love (eros) and the ascent to the Form of Beauty.</li>
            <li><em>Timaeus</em> — cosmology and a model of a rationally ordered universe.</li>
            <li><em>Laws</em> — Plato’s later, more pragmatic treatment of legislation and civic life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Theory of Forms and Key Ideas</h4>
        <p>Plato’s Theory of Forms holds that the visible world is an imperfect copy of a higher reality of eternal,
            changeless
            Forms (Ideas). Knowledge, for Plato, is the intellectual grasp of those Forms—true opinion grounded by
            rational
            insight. His famous <em>Allegory of the Cave</em> (in <em>The Republic</em>) illustrates how prisoners
            perceive
            shadows as reality and must be led out to grasp the light of true being and knowledge.</p>

        <h4>The Academy</h4>
        <p>Plato founded the Academy in Athens (around 387 BCE), a center for philosophical, mathematical, and
            scientific study.
            The Academy attracted students from across the Greek world and persisted as an institution of higher
            learning for
            many centuries. Plato emphasized mathematics within the Academy—famously associating mathematical training
            with the
            development of rational thought and insisting on geometry as central to philosophical education.</p>

        <h4>Plato’s Influence on Philosophy and Science</h4>
        <p>Plato’s work shaped the course of Western thought. His student Aristotle developed systematic logic and
            natural
            philosophy in part through engagement with Platonic ideas. Plato’s emphasis on the role of reason, the
            importance of
            an ordered soul and state, and the interplay between ethics and knowledge influenced later traditions such
            as
            Neoplatonism, Medieval Scholasticism, and Renaissance humanism.</p>

        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>Plato’s Academy, his dialogues, and his metaphysical system left a lasting imprint on intellectual history.
            His
            insistence on philosophical inquiry, dialectic, and the search for universal truths helped establish the
            foundations
            for Western philosophy, political theory, and the role of mathematics in rational inquiry. Through his
            writings,
            Plato continues to be read, taught, and debated across the world.</p>
