        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Democritus</h3>
        <h4>Pre-Socratic Greek Philosopher and Early Atomist (c. 460–370 BCE)</h4>
        <p>Democritus (c. 460–370 BCE) was a pioneering pre-Socratic philosopher best known for developing an early
            theory of
            atomism—the concept that all matter is composed of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms. Although his
            ideas were
            not widely accepted in his time, they remarkably prefigured aspects of modern atomic theory.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Philosophy of Atomism</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Proposed that atoms are eternal, indivisible, and in constant motion through the void (empty space).
            </li>
            <li>Believed that differences in material properties arise from variations in the shape, arrangement, and
                position
                of atoms.</li>
            <li>Rejected supernatural explanations and emphasized natural laws governing the cosmos.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Rational and Orderly Universe</h4>
        <p>Democritus maintained that the universe is rational and orderly, governed by consistent natural laws rather
            than
            chance or divine intervention. This worldview was a radical shift away from mythological explanations
            prevalent in
            ancient Greece.</p>

        <h4>Contributions to Science and Philosophy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Laid groundwork for scientific thinking by emphasizing observation and reason.</li>
            <li>His atomistic theory influenced later philosophers, including Epicurus and Lucretius, and eventually
                contributed
                to the foundation of modern physics and chemistry.</li>
            <li>Explored ethics and human behavior, advocating for moderation and cheerfulness as keys to a good life.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>Although much of Democritus’ work survives only in fragments and reports by later writers, his bold ideas
            about the
            fundamental nature of matter profoundly impacted the development of Western philosophy and science. His
            vision of a
            universe composed of atoms in motion remains a cornerstone of contemporary science.</p>
