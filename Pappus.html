        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Pappus of Alexandria</h3>
        <h4>Last Great Greek Geometer of Antiquity</h4>
        <p>
            Pappus of Alexandria (c. 290 – c. 350 CE) was one of the final great figures of the ancient Greek
            mathematical
            tradition. His monumental work, the <i>Mathematical Collection</i> (<i>Synagoge</i>), served both as a
            compendium of
            earlier mathematics and a repository of original results. Written in eight books, it aimed to preserve and
            explain
            the geometrical and mechanical knowledge of his predecessors, making it a crucial link between ancient and
            medieval
            mathematics.
        </p>
        <img src="Pappus.jpg" alt="Pappus" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Pappus’s writings cover topics ranging from geometry and arithmetic to astronomy and mechanics. In Book VII,
            he
            introduced the <b>Pappus Centroid Theorem</b>, which in modern form states:
            \[
            V = A \cdot d,
            \]
            where \( V \) is the volume of a solid of revolution, \( A \) the generating area, and \( d \) the distance
            traveled
            by its centroid. This result was a precursor to integral calculus, later rediscovered by Cavalieri and
            Guldin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pappus also discussed projective properties of figures, foreshadowing projective geometry. His
            problem-solving style
            often involved geometric transformations, the use of loci, and the construction of ingenious mechanical
            devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was deeply concerned with the methods of analysis and synthesis, the two fundamental approaches in Greek
            mathematics: analysis, which assumes the result and works backward, and synthesis, which builds from known
            principles to prove the result.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <i>Collection</i> preserved many otherwise lost works, including the contributions of Euclid,
            Apollonius, and
            Archimedes. Without Pappus, much of the knowledge from the Hellenistic era might have vanished entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through Arabic translations, Pappus’s influence extended into the Islamic Golden Age, and through Latin
            translations, into Renaissance Europe. He is often regarded as the “last of the great Greek geometers”
            before the
            decline of ancient mathematical scholarship in the West.
        </p>
        <p>
            His blend of exposition, preservation, and innovation makes him a pivotal figure in the bridge between
            classical and
            early modern mathematics.
