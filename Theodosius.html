        <h3>Theodosius: Ancient Master of Spherical Geometry</h3>
        <h4>Pioneer of Spherical Geometry and Astronomy</h4>
        <p>
            Theodosius of Bithynia (c. 160 BCE – c. 100 BCE) was a Greek mathematician and astronomer, best remembered
            for his
            pioneering work in <b>spherical geometry</b>. His writings laid the foundation for understanding the
            geometry of
            spheres, which became essential in astronomy, geography, and navigation for centuries.
        </p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Theodosius was born in Bithynia, a region in northwestern Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). Very little is
            known about
            his personal life, but his influence survives through his writings, especially in astronomy and geometry.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was most famous for his treatise <i>Sphaerics</i>, which systematically studied the geometry of the
            sphere. This
            work was heavily used by ancient astronomers to model the heavens, and it later influenced scholars in the
            Islamic
            Golden Age and Renaissance Europe.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Contributions</h4>

        <h5>(a) Spherical Geometry</h5>
        <p>
            Theodosius extended Euclid’s plane geometry into three dimensions by analyzing circles, angles, and
            triangles drawn
            on the surface of a sphere.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The sum of the angles of a spherical triangle is greater than \(180^\circ\) and less than \(540^\circ\).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Formula:</b><br>
            \[
            \text{Sum of angles} = 180^\circ + E
            \]
            where \(E\) is called the <i>spherical excess</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Relation between arc length (\(s\)), radius (\(r\)), and central angle (\(\theta\) in radians):
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            s = r \times \theta
            \]
        </p>

        <h5>(b) <i>Sphaerics</i> (Book of Spheres)</h5>
        <p>
            This text explained how to calculate distances and angles on a sphere, crucial for astronomy. It was the
            standard
            reference for spherical astronomy until Ptolemy’s <i>Almagest</i>.
        </p>

        <h5>(c) Astronomy and Timekeeping</h5>
        <p>
            Theodosius also wrote about celestial phenomena and the length of days. His work <i>On Days and Nights</i>
            analyzed
            how the length of daylight varies with the seasons and latitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Equation (simplified form used in astronomy):</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            \cos(h) = -\tan(\varphi) \times \tan(\delta)
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            Where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>\(h\) = hour angle of the Sun</li>
            <li>\(\varphi\) = latitude of observer</li>
            <li>\(\delta\) = Sun’s declination</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This helped explain why days are longer in summer and shorter in winter.
        </p>

        <h4>Influence and Legacy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>In Antiquity:</b> His works were essential for ancient astronomers, providing the mathematical
                foundation for
                celestial sphere models.</li>
            <li><b>In the Islamic Golden Age:</b> Scholars like Al-Battani and Al-Tusi used his spherical geometry to
                refine
                astronomical tables.</li>
            <li><b>In the Renaissance:</b> Translations of <i>Sphaerics</i> helped European mathematicians and
                navigators
                improve astronomy and global exploration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>
            Theodosius of Bithynia is remembered as the pioneer of spherical geometry. His clear and systematic approach
            gave
            future astronomers the tools to describe planetary motion, navigation, and the geometry of the heavens.
            Without his
            groundwork, much of classical and medieval astronomy would not have been possible.
