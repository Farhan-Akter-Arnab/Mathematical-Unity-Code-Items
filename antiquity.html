                Mathematicians of the Antiquity: Bridging Hellenistic Knowledge to the Early Medieval Era
            </h3>
            <p>
                From the Late Classical to the Early Medieval period, mathematicians and scholars advanced
                the foundations of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and scientific reasoning.
                Their work transmitted Hellenistic insights into later traditions, laying the groundwork
                for medieval science and mathematics across Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia.
                Figures like Hero of Alexandria and Ptolemy exemplify the fusion of practical engineering,
                observation, and mathematical theory, demonstrating the enduring legacy of ancient scholarship.
