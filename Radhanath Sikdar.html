        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Radhanath Sikdar (1813–1870)</h3>
        <h4>Mathematician and Geodetic Surveyor of Mount Everest</h4>
        
        <p>
            Radhanath Sikdar was an Indian mathematician and surveyor born in <b>Jorasanko, Calcutta</b> on 5 October 1813.
            He studied at <b>Hindu College</b> (now Presidency University), where his talent in <b>mathematics</b> was nurtured
            by John Tytler.
            Sikdar was also associated with the reformist “<b>Young Bengal</b>” circle around Henry Derozio.
        </p>

        <h4>Great Trigonometrical Survey (GTS)</h4>
        <p>
            In 1831, Sikdar joined the <b>Great Trigonometrical Survey of India</b> as a computer, working under Surveyor
            General <b>George Everest</b> and later <b>Andrew Waugh</b>.
            By 1851, he rose to Chief Computer, performing critical geodetic reductions and computations that formed the
            backbone of the Survey’s accuracy.
            Everest described him as “a hardy, energetic young man.”
        </p>
        
        <h4>Measuring the World’s Highest Peak</h4>
        <p>
            Using triangulation data from multiple stations, Sikdar concluded in 1852 that Peak XV was the tallest mountain on
            Earth.
            Andrew Waugh announced this in 1856, naming it <b>Mount Everest</b> after his predecessor.
            Sikdar’s computed height was approximately 29,000 ft; Waugh added 2 ft for official publication (29,002 ft).
            Modern measurements confirm his precision: 8,848 m (29,029 ft) in 1955 and 8,848.86 m (29,032 ft) in 2020.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Mathematical Contributions</h4>
        <p>
            Sikdar’s work involved meticulous <b>geodetic computation</b>: reducing angular observations, applying corrections
            for refraction, altitude, and curvature,
            and solving <b>spherical-trigonometry triangles</b> to convert sighted angles and baselines into peak heights.
            His expertise exemplifies the <b>computational geometry and astronomy</b> tradition of the GTS.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Other Scholarly and Civic Work</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Contributed technical chapters to the 1851 <i>Survey Manual</i>.</li>
            <li>Co-founded the Bengali monthly <i>Māsik Patrikā</i> in 1854 to promote women’s education.</li>
            <li>Protested injustice against survey workers (fined in 1843) demonstrating civic engagement.</li>
            <li>Retired in 1862 and taught mathematics at the <b>General Assembly’s Institution</b> (now Scottish Church
                College).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>
            Radhanath Sikdar exemplifies the <b>Indian mathematical backbone</b> of the Great Trigonometrical Survey.
            His precise spherical-trigonometry calculations, careful error corrections, and large-scale numerical computations
            were critical in establishing Mount Everest’s height.
            Without Sikdar’s expertise, the Survey’s discoveries and the famous “29,002 ft” figure would not have been possible.
            He remains celebrated as a pioneering mathematician and geodetic surveyor of India.
