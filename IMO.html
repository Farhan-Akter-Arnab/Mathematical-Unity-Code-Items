        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)</h3>
        <h4>The Premier Global Contest for Pre-University Problem Solvers</h4>
        
        <!-- Intro -->
        <p class="intro">
            The <b>International Mathematical Olympiad</b> (IMO) is the oldest and most prestigious annual mathematics
            competition for high-school students worldwide. Established in 1959, the IMO brings together the brightest
            young problem solvers from more than a hundred countries for a celebration of mathematical creativity,
            rigorous thinking, and international fellowship.

            <ul class="quick-facts">
                <li><b>Founded:</b> July 1959</li>
                <li><b>Scope:</b> Pre-university (typically up to age 20) international contest</li>
                <li><b>Typical Dates:</b> July (annual)</li>
                <li><b>Format:</b> Two 4.5-hour exam days, 3 problems each day</li>
                <li><b>Participants:</b> Up to 6 students per national team</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                At its core the IMO is a contest of proof — participants tackle challenging olympiad problems
                in geometry, algebra, number theory, and combinatorics. Unlike routine exercises, IMO problems
                reward deep insight, elegant reasoning, and clear presentation of arguments. National delegations
                select and train teams through local and national olympiad systems, culminating in intensive
                training camps before the international event.

            <h4>Origins & Purpose</h4>
            <p>
                The IMO began as a regional initiative and quickly grew into a global institution whose purpose
                is twofold: to stimulate mathematical talent among young people, and to foster international
                cooperation and friendly competition. Over time the IMO has become an incubator of future
                mathematicians, scientists, educators, and technologists.

        <!-- Third section with left-floating image -->
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Structure & Examination Format</h4>
            <p>
                The IMO exam consists of two days of testing. Each day contestants receive a paper with three
                problems and have 4.5 hours to present full solutions. Problems are graded on a detailed rubric;
                partial credit is awarded for correct, well-explained steps. The total maximum score per contestant
                is 42 points (each problem worth 7 points).
            </p>
            <p>
                Teams are accompanied by leaders and mentors who coordinate selection and translations, and who
                later form the international jury that selects problems and finalizes scores. The host country
                organizes cultural events alongside the contest to promote cross-cultural exchange.

            <h4>Scoring, Medals & Awards</h4>
            <p>
                Medals (gold, silver, bronze) and honorable mentions are awarded according to fixed proportions;
                typically about half of contestants receive a medal. In addition to individual recognitions,
                some IMOs present special prizes for particularly elegant solutions, and teams gain honor by
                strong collective performance.

        <div class="section">
            <h4>Notable Participants & Records</h4>
            <p>
                Many IMO alumni have become prominent researchers, professors, and leaders in STEM fields.
                Records and milestones — such as perfect scores, highest cumulative country rankings, and youngest
                medallists — are celebrated within the global olympiad community and often inspire future students.

            <h4>Hosting & Global Rotation</h4>
            <p>
                The IMO is hosted by a different country each year. Host nations handle problem selection, logistics,
                venues, and cultural programs. Hosting duties rotate across continents and provide opportunities
                for local mathematical communities to showcase their traditions while welcoming international visitors.

        <div class="section">
            <h4>Problem Style & Training</h4>
            <p>
                IMO-style problems emphasize rigorous proofs: contestants must justify every claim and structure
                solutions with clarity. Training for the IMO commonly involves problem classes, mock contests,
                and guided mentorship — activities that strengthen logical thinking and expose students to creative
                mathematical strategies.

        <div class="section">
            <h4>Relation to National Olympiads (e.g., BdMO)</h4>
            <p>
                National olympiad systems serve as feeders to the IMO: local contests, regional rounds, and national
                training camps identify talented students and prepare them for international competition. Programs
                like BdMO cultivate regional talent and help national selectors prepare strong, well-trained teams.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Ninth section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Challenges & Future Prospects</h4>
            <p>
                Contemporary challenges include ensuring equitable access to training, bridging disparities between
                countries with differing resources, and maintaining rigorous, fair selection processes. Future prospects
                center on broader outreach, digital training platforms, and collaborations that expand opportunities for
                underrepresented regions.

        <!-- Closing & legacy -->
        <p class="closing">
            The IMO has, for decades, celebrated young mathematical talent while forging connections across nations.
            Beyond medals and rankings, its lasting legacy is a worldwide community of problem solvers and mentors
            who advance mathematical thinking and inspire generations of students to explore the beauty of proof.
