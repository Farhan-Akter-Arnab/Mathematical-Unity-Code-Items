        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Nasir-ud-Din al-Tusi</h3>
        <h4>Scholar of Astronomy, Mathematics, and Philosophy</h4>
        <h5><i><strong>Not to be confused with <a href="Sharaf ad-Din at-Tusi.html" style="color:white;">Sharaf ad-Din
                        al-Tusi!!! (Clickable Link)</a></strong></i></h5>
        <p>Nasir-ud-Din al-Tusi (1201 – 1274 CE), full name Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Tusi, was a Persian
            polymath
            who made significant contributions to astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, and theology during the Islamic
            Golden
            Age. Born in Tus, in the region of Khorasan (present-day Iran), al-Tusi became one of the most influential
            scholars
            of the 13th century. He produced over 150 works across various disciplines, many of which were later
            translated into
            Latin and influenced European Renaissance thinkers.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>Al-Tusi made remarkable contributions to trigonometry, establishing it as an independent branch of
            mathematics. He
            was one of the first to treat trigonometry as a mathematical science rather than a tool of astronomy. His
            work
            <i>“Treatise on the Complete Quadrilateral”</i> systematically defined the six fundamental trigonometric
            functions
            and presented the law of sines for both plane and spherical triangles:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>\[ \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} \]</li>
        </ul>

        <p>He also derived the spherical law of sines and established relationships between sides and angles in
            spherical
            triangles, which became foundational for later Islamic and European astronomy. His text <i>“Al-Tadhkira fi
                Ilm
                al-Hay’a”</i> (Memoir on Astronomy) corrected and improved many aspects of the Ptolemaic model,
            introducing the
            famous “Tusi Couple” — a geometric model involving two circular motions that produced linear motion, used to
            explain
            planetary behavior without violating uniform circular motion.</p>

        <p>Al-Tusi headed the Maragha Observatory, one of the most advanced scientific institutions of its time, where
            he led a
            team of scholars and produced highly accurate astronomical tables known as the “Zij-i Ilkhani.” His
            mathematical
            innovations, especially in trigonometry and geometry, helped lay the groundwork for later developments in
            mathematical astronomy.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Established trigonometry as an independent mathematical discipline</li>
            <li>Introduced the law of sines and advanced spherical trigonometry</li>
            <li>Proposed the Tusi Couple to resolve issues in planetary motion models</li>
            <li>Directed the Maragha Observatory, producing precise astronomical data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Nasir-ud-Din al-Tusi’s influence extended beyond mathematics and science. He also wrote extensively on
            ethics, logic,
            and metaphysics, blending Islamic thought with Greek philosophy. His legacy lives on in both Islamic and
            Western
            scientific traditions, and he is remembered as one of the most brilliant minds of medieval science.</p>
