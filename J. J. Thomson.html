        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>J.J. Thomson</h3>
        <h4>Discoverer of the Electron</h4>
        <p>Joseph John Thomson (1856–1940) was a British physicist who fundamentally changed our understanding of the
            atom. Born
            in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, England, Thomson displayed early brilliance in mathematics and science. He
            became a
            professor at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, where his experiments in cathode rays led to one of the
            most
            significant discoveries in modern physics: the electron.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Discovery of the Electron</h4>
        <p>In 1897, Thomson conducted experiments with cathode ray tubes and observed that the rays were deflected by
            electric
            and magnetic fields. He concluded that the rays were composed of negatively charged particles, which were
            much
            smaller than atoms. He called these particles “corpuscles,” now known as electrons.</p>
        <p>Thomson estimated the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron as:</p>
        \[
        \frac{e}{m} \approx 1.7588 \times 10^{11} \ \text{C/kg}
        \]
        <p>He also measured the electron's charge \( e \) using experiments similar to Millikan's later, allowing
            calculation of
            its mass \( m \) using:</p>
        \[
        m = \frac{e}{(e/m)}
        \]
        <p>This discovery proved that atoms were not indivisible, as previously thought, and introduced the concept of
            subatomic
            particles.</p>

        <h4>Plum Pudding Model</h4>
        <p>Following the discovery of the electron, Thomson proposed the <em>plum pudding model</em> of the atom, in
            which
            electrons were embedded within a positively charged “soup” or matrix, similar to plums in a pudding. This
            was one of
            the earliest atomic models attempting to explain the internal structure of atoms.</p>
        <p>A simplified representation of the model can be described as:</p>
        \[
        \text{Atom} = \text{positively charged sphere} + \sum_{i} e^{-}_{i} \text{(electrons embedded)}
        \]
        <p>Although later refined by Rutherford and others, this model was critical in moving science beyond the idea of
            indivisible atoms.</p>

        <h4>Experiments and Methods</h4>
        <p>Thomson’s work involved precise measurements using cathode ray tubes, electrometers, and magnetic deflection
            apparatus. He measured the deflection of cathode rays under varying electric and magnetic fields to
            determine their
            properties, setting new standards for experimental physics. He also investigated the conduction of
            electricity in
            gases and the behavior of ions.</p>

        <h4>Recognition and Awards</h4>
        <p>For his pioneering work, Thomson received numerous accolades, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906
            for his
            theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity in gases. His research
            influenced later
            atomic models and the development of quantum mechanics.</p>

        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>J.J. Thomson’s discovery of the electron reshaped chemistry and physics by showing that atoms were made of
            smaller
            constituents. His experiments paved the way for the development of quantum theory, particle physics, and
            modern
            electronics. Thomson’s meticulous experimental approach and conceptual innovations make him a cornerstone in
            the
            history of science.</p>

        <h4>Visualizing the Plum Pudding Model</h4>
        <p>In LaTeX, a schematic of the Plum Pudding Model can be depicted as:</p>
        \[
        \begin{array}{c}
        \text{Positively charged sphere} \\
        \bullet \quad \bullet \quad \bullet \quad \bullet \quad \bullet \\
        \text{Electrons (negative) embedded inside}
        \end{array}
        \]
        <p>This simple diagram shows electrons scattered within the positively charged atomic matrix.</p>
