        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Takakazu Seki</h3>
        <h4>Founder of Japanese Mathematics (Wasan)</h4>
        <p>
            Takakazu Seki (1642–1708), often hailed as the “Newton of Japan,” was the leading figure of Wasan, the
            Japanese
            school of mathematics that flourished independently from European traditions. Largely self-taught, Seki
            studied
            Chinese texts before developing original methods that paralleled key ideas of Western mathematics. He is
            best known
            for introducing early forms of determinants to solve systems of equations, centuries before Cramer’s Rule
            was
            formalized in Europe. His insights into polynomial equations and algebra also anticipated techniques later
            used by
            European mathematicians.
        </p>
        <img src="Takakazu Seki.jpg" alt="Takakazu Seki" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Seki’s work on <i>Enri</i> (circle principle) provided approaches to approximating areas of circles and
            curved
            figures, foreshadowing integral calculus. For instance, he investigated infinite processes similar to the
            method of
            exhaustion, which can be expressed today in the language of limits:
            \
            This demonstrates how his methods approached modern integration. His most famous treatise, <i>Katsuyō
                Sanpō</i>,
            contained problems on algebra, geometry, and combinatorics that revealed striking originality, including
            results
            akin to the binomial theorem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though Japan was isolated during the Edo period, Seki’s innovations illustrate a remarkable parallel
            development of
            mathematical thought. He established a strong school of disciples, ensuring the spread of Wasan throughout
            the
            country. His emphasis on rigorous problem-solving, creative use of algebra, and adaptation of infinite
            processes
            secured his legacy as the founder of Japanese mathematics. Today, he is celebrated for showing that
            mathematical
            creativity flourished independently across cultures.
