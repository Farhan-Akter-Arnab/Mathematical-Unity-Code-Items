        <h3>Anaximander of Miletus</h3>
        <h4>The Boundless Philosopher</h4>
        <p>
            Anaximander (c. 610 BCE – c. 546 BCE) was a Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, astronomer, and cartographer, and a
            student of <b>Thales of Miletus</b>. He is often credited as one of the earliest thinkers to attempt a scientific
            explanation of the cosmos without relying on myth. His ideas about the origin of the universe, the Earth’s position
            in space, and the principle of the <i>apeiron</i> (the boundless) make him one of the founders of natural
            philosophy.
        </p>

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Anaximander was born in Miletus, a wealthy Ionian city, where early Greek science and philosophy flourished. Like
            his teacher Thales, he sought natural explanations for phenomena rather than divine myths. He is said to have been
            politically active and may have even designed the first map of the known world.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>(a) The Apeiron</b><br>
                Anaximander proposed that the origin (\(\text{archê}\)) of all things is not a specific element like water (as
                Thales believed), but something indefinite, eternal, and infinite — the <i>apeiron</i> (“boundless” or
                “infinite”).<br><br>
                From the <i>apeiron</i>, opposites such as hot/cold, wet/dry separate to form the cosmos.<br><br>
                This was one of the earliest abstract principles in philosophy.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <b>(b) Cosmology</b><br>
                Anaximander believed the Earth floats unsupported in space, not held by anything — a radical idea at the
                time.<br><br>
                He thought the Earth was cylindrical in shape, like a drum, with humans living on the flat top.<br><br>
                He explained celestial bodies as fiery rings encased in air, with holes through which light escapes (appearing
                as the Sun, Moon, and stars).
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <b>(c) Astronomy & Instruments</b><br>
                He is credited with introducing the <b>gnomon</b> (a sundial-like device) to Greece, allowing measurement of
                solstices and equinoxes.<br><br>
                He proposed a model of the heavens where the Sun, Moon, and stars are located on concentric circles around Earth
                at different distances.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <b>(d) Biology & Evolutionary Thought</b><br>
                Anaximander speculated about the origin of life:<br><br>
                Life began in moisture, heated by the Sun.<br><br>
                Humans originally came from fish-like creatures, since human infants are too helpless to survive alone.<br><br>
                This makes him one of the earliest thinkers to propose a kind of evolutionary theory.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Influence and Legacy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>On Greek Philosophy:</b> His idea of the <i>apeiron</i> influenced later philosophers such as Anaximenes,
                Aristotle, and the Stoics.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Science:</b> His theory of a self-suspended Earth anticipated later astronomical reasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Cartography:</b> He drew one of the earliest maps of the world, making geography a field of study.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Biology:</b> His idea of life arising from water influenced later naturalists like Empedocles and even
                foreshadows Darwinian thinking.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>
            Anaximander was a true pioneer, bridging myth and science. By proposing the <i>apeiron</i> as the eternal source of
            all things, and by imagining the Earth floating in space, he moved philosophy toward abstraction and scientific
            inquiry. His vision of the cosmos laid foundations for both philosophy and astronomy, making him one of the great
            minds of early Greek thought.
