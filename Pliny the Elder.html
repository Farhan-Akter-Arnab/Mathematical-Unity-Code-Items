        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Pliny the Elder</h3>
        <h4>Roman Naturalist, Historian, and Encyclopedist</h4>
        <p>
            Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE), or Gaius Plinius Secundus, was a Roman polymath whose <i>Natural History</i> (Naturalis
            Historia) is among the largest works of reference to survive from antiquity. Although Pliny was not a mathematician
            in the technical sense, his encyclopedic compilation preserved vast swaths of Greco-Roman knowledge in natural
            science, geography, anthropology, botany, and mineralogy. His aim was to gather, systematize, and render accessible
            the learning of earlier authors, from Aristotle to Roman engineers, within a single Latin prose corpus.
        </p>
        <img src="Pliny the Elder.webp" alt="Pliny the Elder" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Pliny’s geography and cosmology reflect the Roman appropriation of Greek science. He described Earth as a sphere,
            citing earlier authorities like Hipparchus and Posidonius, and supplied rough estimates of Earth’s circumference.
            His ethnographic accounts, while colored by Roman imperial ideology, remain invaluable for historians because they
            preserve fragments from lost works. In mineralogy and metallurgy, he recorded practical techniques—such as smelting,
            coin minting, and pigment preparation—that allow modern researchers to reconstruct Roman technical culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            While his methodology often lacked critical distinction between observation and hearsay, Pliny nonetheless conveyed
            quantitative details, such as astronomical cycles or river lengths. His adoption of ratios and measures—often
            expressed in Roman units like <i>stadia</i> or miles—links his compendium with the broader tradition of scientific
            description. For example, he gave eclipse periodicities, echoing the <i>Saros</i> cycle known from Babylonian and
            Greek astronomy, approximated as 223 lunar months.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pliny’s death during the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE is emblematic of his scientific curiosity: as admiral of the
            Roman fleet, he sailed toward the eruption to investigate its phenomena and to rescue survivors, succumbing to
            volcanic fumes. His nephew, Pliny the Younger, preserved an eyewitness account that is still one of the earliest
            scientific descriptions of a volcanic eruption. Thus, Pliny the Elder represents both the encyclopedic ambition of
            Roman science and the spirit of natural inquiry, ensuring that fragments of classical science endured into the
            Middle Ages and Renaissance.
