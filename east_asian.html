            <h3>East Asian Mathematicians</h3>
            <p>
                East Asia cultivated mathematical traditions that matured into lasting contributions to arithmetic,
                algebra,
                geometry,
                astronomy, and computation. Scholars across China, Korea, and Japan pursued order through
                calculation—tracing numerical
                patterns, refining algorithms, and modeling natural phenomena. From early masters who systematized
                counting
                methods and
                approximated π to later innovators who advanced series, equations, and proto-calculus, these
                mathematicians
                forged
                practical yet profound approaches to reasoning that influenced regional science and ultimately enriched
                the
                global
                history of mathematics worldwide.
