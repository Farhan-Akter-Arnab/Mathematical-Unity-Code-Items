        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Michael Faraday</h3>
        <h4>Pioneering Experimental Physicist and Chemist</h4>
        <p>Michael Faraday (1791–1867) was a British scientist whose experiments and discoveries laid the groundwork for
            modern
            electromagnetism and electrochemistry. Born in Newington Butts, England, Faraday came from a humble
            background and
            had minimal formal education. Through curiosity, determination, and apprenticeship with a bookbinder, he
            gained
            access to scientific literature and eventually secured a position as a laboratory assistant to Sir Humphry
            Davy at
            the Royal Institution.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Contributions to Electromagnetism</h4>
        <p>Faraday’s most celebrated work involved the study of electricity and magnetism. He discovered electromagnetic
            induction, demonstrating that a changing magnetic field could induce an electric current in a conductor.
            This
            principle is now mathematically expressed as:</p>
        \[
        \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
        \]
        <p>This fundamental law, known as Faraday’s law of induction, became a cornerstone of classical electromagnetism
            and was
            later incorporated into James Clerk Maxwell’s equations.</p>

        <h4>Electrochemistry</h4>
        <p>Faraday also made pioneering contributions to electrochemistry. He formulated the laws of electrolysis,
            quantifying
            the relationship between the amount of electric charge passed through a substance and the amount of chemical
            change
            produced. These can be expressed as:</p>
        \[
        m = \frac{Q \cdot M}{n \cdot F}
        \]
        <p>where \( m \) is the mass of the substance deposited, \( Q \) is the total electric charge, \( M \) is the
            molar
            mass, \( n \) is the number of electrons involved in the reaction, and \( F \) is Faraday’s constant.</p>

        <h4>Magnetism and the Faraday Cage</h4>
        <p>Faraday discovered that magnetic fields could influence materials and also invented the Faraday cage — a
            device that
            shields sensitive equipment from external electric fields. He showed that charges reside only on the
            external
            surface of conductors, an insight that is fundamental in electromagnetism.</p>

        <h4>Other Contributions and Legacy</h4>
        <p>Faraday’s work extended beyond physics and chemistry. He introduced concepts such as lines of force, which
            helped
            visualize electromagnetic fields, and he worked on diamagnetism and electrostatic phenomena. Despite having
            little
            formal education, he was a brilliant experimentalist and an excellent communicator, inspiring generations of
            scientists. His discoveries form the practical basis for electric motors, transformers, and generators,
            making him
            one of the most influential figures in science history.</p>
