        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Al-Qalasadi</h3>
        <h4>Pioneer of Algebraic Symbolism in the Islamic World</h4>
        <p>Al-Qalasadi (1412 – 1486 CE), full name Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Qalasadi, was a prominent Arab
            mathematician
            from Al-Andalus, born in Baza near Granada in modern-day Spain. He is especially known for being one of the
            first
            mathematicians in the Islamic world to use algebraic symbolism systematically — a significant step in the
            evolution
            of algebra toward symbolic abstraction.</p>
        <img src="Al-Qalasadi.jpg" alt="Al-Qalasadi" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>Al-Qalasadi lived during a period of cultural transition in the late Nasrid Kingdom of Granada and eventually
            migrated to North Africa due to political unrest. He studied religious sciences and mathematics, integrating
            logical
            and philosophical rigor into his mathematical approach. His contributions reflect the culmination of
            centuries of
            Arabic mathematical tradition, while also laying groundwork for the symbolic algebra that would emerge in
            Europe.
        </p>

        <p>One of his key works is the <i>Sharh al-Tuhfat al-Bahiyya</i>, a commentary on earlier algebraic texts, where
            he
            introduced symbols for mathematical operations and variables. These symbols were primitive compared to
            modern
            notation but marked a crucial innovation in expressing algebraic ideas concisely and consistently. He used
            Arabic
            letters to denote unknowns and operations — such as addition, subtraction, and extraction of roots —
            facilitating a
            more generalized approach to solving equations.</p>

        <p>Al-Qalasadi also contributed to arithmetic and number theory, particularly in the context of inheritance
            calculations, commercial transactions, and legal rulings in Islamic jurisprudence. His methods involved the
            systematic use of fractions, ratios, and roots, and he continued the tradition of solving polynomial
            equations
            algebraically. He worked on indeterminate problems and equations of the form:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\</li>
            <li>\</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Among the earliest Islamic mathematicians to use symbolic algebra notation</li>
            <li>Authored texts integrating mathematics with Islamic law and inheritance</li>
            <li>Used systematic methods to handle fractions, roots, and polynomials</li>
            <li>Bridged classical Arabic mathematics and European symbolic developments</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Al-Qalasadi's legacy lies in his effort to simplify and systematize algebraic procedures, setting the stage
            for the
            algebraic formalism that would emerge in Renaissance Europe. His innovations in symbolic representation and
            structured computation influenced both Islamic and Western mathematical traditions, making him a critical
            figure in
            the historical development of algebra.</p>
