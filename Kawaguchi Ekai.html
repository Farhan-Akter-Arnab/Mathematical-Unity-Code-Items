        <h3>Kawaguchi Ekai (Nyozekan)</h3>
        <h4>Buddhist Scholar and Scientific Thinker</h4>
        <p>
            Kawaguchi Ekai (1866–1945) was a Japanese Buddhist monk, scholar, and explorer who also contributed to the spread of
            scientific thought in Japan. Though best known for his travels to Tibet and Nepal, he engaged deeply with Western
            science and mathematics, integrating them into his educational and philosophical work.
        </p>
        <img src="Kawaguchi Ekai.jpg" alt="Kawaguchi Ekai" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Kawaguchi advocated the compatibility of Buddhist philosophy with modern science, emphasizing rationality,
            observation, and logical reasoning. He introduced elements of scientific and mathematical thought to Buddhist
            education, including basic astronomy, geometry, and natural sciences. While not primarily a research mathematician,
            his writings used examples from mathematics—such as ratios, proportions, and geometric reasoning—to illustrate
            Buddhist concepts of harmony and order.
        </p>
        <p>
            He frequently invoked mathematical analogies, for instance, using proportional reasoning:
            \[ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \]
            to discuss balance and interdependence in both physical and spiritual domains. His intellectual mission was to
            modernize Buddhist learning by showing its compatibility with global scientific knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kawaguchi’s legacy lies in his role as a cultural mediator: he helped bring both Tibetan traditions to Japan and
            Western scientific ideas to Buddhist circles. Though not a mathematician in the technical sense, his promotion of
            mathematical and scientific literacy marked an important step in Japan’s broader intellectual modernization.
