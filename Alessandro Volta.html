        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Alessandro Volta</h3>
        <h4>Inventor of the Electric Battery and Pioneer of Electromagnetism</h4>
        <p>Alessandro Volta (1745–1827) was an Italian physicist and chemist born in Como, Lombardy. He made
            groundbreaking
            contributions to the study of electricity and electrochemistry, most notably inventing the first electric
            battery,
            the **voltaic pile**, effectively launching the age of electrical science.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Early Career and Discoveries</h4>
        <p>Volta became a professor of physics at the Royal School in Como in 1774 and later held the chair of
            experimental
            physics at the University of Pavia for nearly 40 years :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. In 1775, he
            improved
            the electrophorus—a device to generate static electricity—and in 1776, he discovered and isolated methane
            gas
            :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.</p>

        <h4>Volta vs. Galvani: Uncovering Contact Electricity</h4>
        <p>In the late 1780s, Volta challenged Luigi Galvani’s theory of “animal electricity” by demonstrating that the
            twitching of frog legs was due to electrical currents from dissimilar metals—what Volta called “metallic
            electricity”—not inherent animal force :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. This insight led directly to
            his most
            famous invention.</p>

        <h4>The Voltaic Pile</h4>
        <p>In 1799, Volta built the **voltaic pile**, consisting of alternating discs of zinc and copper separated by
            brine-soaked cardboard or cloth :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. It was the first device to produce a
            steady,
            continuous electric current—unlike the static discharge of a Leyden jar—and marked the invention of the
            modern
            battery :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.</p>

        <p>The voltaic pile enabled rapid scientific advances: within weeks, William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle used
            it to
            decompose water by electrolysis, and Humphry Davy discovered new elements such as sodium and potassium
            :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. The volt, now the SI unit of electric potential, was later named in
            Volta’s
            honor :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.</p>

        <h4>Recognition and Honors</h4>
        <p>Volta demonstrated his invention before Napoleon in Paris, who rewarded him with a gold medal and later made
            him a
            count and senator of Lombardy :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. The Austrian emperor also appointed him
            director of the philosophy faculty at the University of Padua in 1815 :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.
        </p>

        <h4>Scientific Legacy</h4>
        <p>Volta’s work laid the foundation for electrochemistry and the systematic study of electricity. He formulated
            what
            became known as **Volta’s law of the electrochemical series**, expressing how differences in electrode
            potentials
            drive current generation :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. He also studied electrical capacitance,
            linking
            electric potential \( V \) and charge \( Q \) through direct proportionality (a principle named Volta’s Law
            of
            Capacitance) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.</p>

        <h4>Commemoration</h4>
        <p>Volta retired to his estate near Como in 1819 and died in 1827 :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. In
            Como, the
            **Tempio Voltiano**, a temple-style museum, was built to house his scientific instruments and manuscripts,
            and
            stands today as a tribute to his legacy :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. The Volta Prize,
            established by
            Napoleon III in 1852, was also named in his honor to support achievements related to electricity
            :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.</p>

        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>Alessandro Volta’s invention of the voltaic pile not only disproved living tissue as the source of
            electricity but
            also created a continuous source of current, revolutionizing scientific exploration. His contributions
            underpin
            fundamental concepts in electricity and electrochemistry, and his name lives on in the unit “volt,” the
            museum
            honoring his work, and institutions that continue to promote his scientific vision.</p>
