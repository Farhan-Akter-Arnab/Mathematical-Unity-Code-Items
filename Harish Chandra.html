        <h3>Harish-Chandra</h3>
        <h4>Pioneer of Representation Theory and Lie Groups (1923 – 1983)</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Early Life and Education</b><br>
            Harish-Chandra was born on October 11, 1923, in Kanpur, India. He showed an early aptitude for mathematics
            and
            physics, earning a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from Allahabad University in 1940.
            He later moved to the University of Cambridge, where he earned a degree in mathematics, and then pursued
            advanced
            studies at the University of Chicago, obtaining his PhD in physics under guidance that
            combined both mathematics and theoretical physics.

        <p>
            <b>Contributions</b><br>
            Harish-Chandra is renowned for his profound contributions to representation theory, particularly the study
            of Lie
            groups and Lie algebras.
            His work bridged the gap between abstract algebra, harmonic analysis, and quantum physics.
        <ul>
            <li>Developed the <b>Harish-Chandra isomorphism</b>, a fundamental result in representation theory.</li>
            <li>Formulated the <b>Plancherel formula</b> for semisimple Lie groups, central to harmonic analysis.</li>
            <li>Laid the foundations for understanding <b>infinite-dimensional representations</b> of classical groups,
                impacting both mathematics and theoretical physics.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Selected Mathematical Concept</b><br>
            One of his key results is the <b>Harish-Chandra homomorphism</b>, which relates invariant differential
            operators on
            a Lie algebra
            <em>g</em> to symmetric polynomials on a Cartan subalgebra <em>h</em>:
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
            <code>Z<sub>g</sub> ≅ S<sub>h</sub><sup>W</sup></code>
        </p>

        <p>
            where <em>Z<sub>g</sub></em> is the center of the universal enveloping algebra of <em>g</em>,
            <em>S<sub>h</sub></em> is the symmetric algebra of <em>h</em>, and <em>W</em> is the Weyl group.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Legacy</b><br>
            Harish-Chandra’s work laid the foundation for modern representation theory and influenced fields ranging
            from
            quantum mechanics to number theory.
            He received numerous accolades, including the Cole Prize in Algebra and recognition from the National
            Academy of
            Sciences.
            He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society and received the <b>Padma Bhushan</b> in 1977.
            In 1981, Yale University awarded him an honorary degree.
        </p>

        <p>
            The mathematics department of V.S.S.D. College, Kanpur, celebrates his birthday annually with lectures and
            visits to
            the
            <b>Harish-Chandra Research Institute</b>, an institution in India named in his honor.
            Robert Langlands, in a biographical article, wrote:
            <em>
                “He was considered for the Fields Medal in 1958, but a forceful member of the selection committee in
                whose eyes
                Thom was a Bourbakist
                was determined not to have two. So Harish-Chandra, whom he also placed on the Bourbaki camp, was set
                aside.”
            </em>
