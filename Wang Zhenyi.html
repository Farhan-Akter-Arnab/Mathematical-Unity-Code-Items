        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Wang Zhenyi</h3>
        <h4>Female Pioneer of Mathematics and Astronomy in Qing China</h4>
        <p>
            Wang Zhenyi (1768–1797) was an extraordinary mathematician, astronomer, and poet of the Qing dynasty,
            renowned for
            breaking gender barriers in the male-dominated intellectual world of 18th-century China. Despite social
            restrictions, she mastered advanced subjects such as algebra, geometry, and astronomy, becoming a role model
            for
            future generations.
        </p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            In mathematics, Wang focused on simplifying complex problems so that students could understand them more
            clearly.
            She studied Euclidean geometry and Chinese algebra, writing explanatory essays and designing simple teaching
            aids.
            One of her notable works was an essay on the <b>binomial theorem</b>, where she explained the expansion of
            powers
            such as:
            \[
            (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
            \]
            She extended this logic to higher powers, demonstrating remarkable mathematical clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her interests extended to astronomy. She carefully observed lunar eclipses and explained them scientifically
            by
            modeling the Sun, Earth, and Moon with a lamp and mirrors. In doing so, she debunked superstitions that
            linked
            eclipses to heavenly omens, emphasizing natural laws instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a poet, she celebrated intellectual freedom and criticized gender inequality, expressing that women were
            equally
            capable of learning and reasoning. Though she died at the young age of 29, Wang Zhenyi left behind a legacy
            of
            courage, intellect, and pioneering scholarship, making her one of the most remarkable women in the history
            of
            science.
        </p>
