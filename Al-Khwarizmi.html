        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</h3>
        <h4>Father of Algebra and Pioneer of Algorithms</h4>
        <p>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (c. 780 – c. 850 CE) was a Persian polymath who made foundational
            contributions to
            mathematics, astronomy, and geography. Born in Khwarazm (modern-day Khiva, Uzbekistan), he worked in the
            prestigious
            <i>House of Wisdom</i> in Baghdad under the Abbasid Caliphate. There, he engaged in translation,
            preservation, and
            expansion of classical Greek and Indian works, and significantly advanced mathematical knowledge in the
            Islamic
            Golden Age.
        </p>
        <img src="Al-Khwarizmi.jpg" alt="Al-Khwarizmi" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>Al-Khwarizmi is best known for his book <i>Al-Kitāb al-Mukhtaṣar fī Ḥisāb al-Jabr wal-Muqābala</i> (The
            Compendious
            Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing), written around 820 CE. This treatise systematically laid
            out
            methods for solving linear and quadratic equations using logical, step-by-step instructions — thus
            establishing the
            field of <b>algebra</b>. The term "algebra" itself is derived from the word <i>al-jabr</i> in the book’s
            title.</p>

        <p>In his algebraic methods, al-Khwarizmi solved equations such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\[ax^2 + bx = c\]</li>
            <li>\[ax^2 = bx + c\]</li>
            <li>\[ax^2 + c = bx\]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He employed rhetorical algebra, explaining procedures in words, as symbolic notation had not yet been
            developed. His
            step-by-step approach later influenced European mathematics through Latin translations in the 12th century.
        </p>

        <p>Al-Khwarizmi also introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals to the Islamic world, which later reached Europe and
            replaced
            Roman numerals. His arithmetic text on calculation using Indian numerals, known in Latin as <i>Algoritmi de
                Numero
                Indorum</i>, is the root of the word <b>algorithm</b>, showcasing his lasting impact on computation and
            computer
            science.</p>

        <p>In addition to algebra and arithmetic, he contributed significantly to trigonometry, producing sine and
            cosine tables
            accurate for their time. In geography, his work <i>Kitāb Ṣūrat al-Arḍ</i> (Book of the Description of the
            Earth)
            revised and corrected Ptolemy’s geographical data. He created detailed maps and determined coordinates for
            thousands
            of locations, making significant improvements in cartography and navigation.</p>

        <p>His works were translated into Latin and widely studied in medieval Europe, becoming standard references in
            mathematical education. Al-Khwarizmi’s influence extended to scholars like Fibonacci, and his methods laid
            the
            groundwork for later algebraic developments.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Popularized decimal positional number system</li>
            <li>Systematized solution methods for quadratic equations</li>
            <li>Defined arithmetic algorithms, inspiring future computation</li>
            <li>Contributed to astronomical tables and refined geographic coordinates</li>
        </ul>

        <p>He is rightly celebrated as one of the most influential scientists of all time. The very terms "algebra" and
            "algorithm" are derived from his works, and his legacy remains integral to modern mathematics and computer
            science.
