        <h3>Nicomachus of Gerasa</h3>
        <h4>Neo-Pythagorean Master of Number Theory and Arithmetic</h4>
        <p>
            Nicomachus of Gerasa (c. 60–c. 120 CE) was a Greco-Roman mathematician and philosopher whose works preserved
            and
            expanded the arithmetical traditions of Pythagoras and Plato. Born in Gerasa (modern Jerash, Jordan),
            Nicomachus was
            a leading figure of the Neo-Pythagorean school, which viewed mathematics not merely as a computational tool
            but as a
            key to understanding the cosmos and divine order.
        </p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            His most influential surviving work is <i>Introduction to Arithmetic</i> (<i>Arithmetike eisagoge</i>),
            which
            presents a systematic account of number theory in a form accessible to learners of his era. Rather than
            focusing on
            practical calculation, Nicomachus emphasized the qualitative properties of numbers, categorizing them into
            types
            such as even, odd, prime, composite, perfect, abundant, and deficient. A perfect number, according to him,
            is one
            where the sum of its proper divisors equals the number itself. For example, \(6 = 1 + 2 + 3\), and \(28 = 1
            + 2 + 4
            + 7 + 14\).
            This fascination with numerical perfection reflected a deeper metaphysical belief: that numbers were the
            foundation
            of all reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nicomachus also explored polygonal numbers, figurate numbers, and mathematical harmonics—the numerical
            ratios
            underlying musical intervals. In this, he echoed Pythagorean thought, linking the structure of numbers to
            the
            harmony of the universe. For instance, he noted that the octave corresponds to the ratio \(2:1\), the fifth
            to
            \(3:2\), and the fourth to \(4:3\).
        </p>
        <p>
            Although his work lacked the rigorous proofs of Euclid’s <i>Elements</i>, it had immense influence during
            Late
            Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The Latin translation by Boethius ensured that Nicomachus’s ideas shaped
            medieval
            European mathematics, especially in the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). His
            emphasis on
            classification and symbolism appealed to scholars who saw mathematics as a philosophical and mystical
            discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nicomachus’s legacy lies in his role as a transmitter of Greek number theory and as a figure who bridged
            computation, philosophy, and cosmology. While modern mathematics demands more proof-based rigor, his vision
            of
            numbers as the key to cosmic harmony continues to inspire historical and philosophical reflections on
            mathematics.
