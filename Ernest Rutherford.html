        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Ernest Rutherford</h3>
        <h4>Father of Nuclear Physics</h4>
        <p>Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) was a New Zealand-born physicist whose groundbreaking work on radioactivity and
            the
            structure of the atom earned him the title “Father of Nuclear Physics.” Born in Brightwater, New Zealand,
            Rutherford
            demonstrated early scientific talent and pursued higher education at the University of New Zealand and later
            at
            Cambridge University under J.J. Thomson.</p>

        <h4>Research on Radioactivity</h4>
        <p>Rutherford conducted pioneering research on radioactive substances, identifying and naming alpha and beta
            radiation.
            He also discovered that radioactive decay transforms one element into another, effectively being the first
            to
            observe nuclear transmutation. His work led to the formulation of the <em>half-life</em> concept, describing
            the
            time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay:</p>
        \[
        N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}
        \]
        <p>Where \( N(t) \) is the number of undecayed nuclei at time \( t \), \( N_0 \) is the initial number of
            nuclei, and \(
            \lambda \) is the decay constant.</p>

        <h4>Gold Foil Experiment</h4>
        <p>Rutherford’s most famous experiment, conducted with Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in 1909, involved firing
            alpha
            particles at a thin sheet of gold foil. The results were surprising:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Most alpha particles passed straight through.</li>
            <li>A few particles were deflected at large angles.</li>
            <li>Some bounced almost directly back.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These observations could not be explained by the Plum Pudding Model and led Rutherford to propose a new
            atomic
            structure.</p>

        <h4>Nuclear Model of the Atom</h4>
        <p>Based on the gold foil experiment, Rutherford proposed the <em>nuclear model</em> of the atom:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The atom consists mostly of empty space.</li>
            <li>All positive charge and most of the mass are concentrated in a tiny, dense nucleus.</li>
            <li>Electrons orbit the nucleus, similar to planets around the Sun.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The nuclear model can be expressed schematically in LaTeX as:</p>
        \[
        \text{Atom} = \text{Nucleus (positive, dense)} + \sum_i e^-_i \text{(electrons orbiting)}
        \]

        <h4>Discovery of the Proton</h4>
        <p>In 1917, Rutherford conducted experiments bombarding nitrogen gas with alpha particles, observing the
            emission of
            hydrogen nuclei. He concluded that the hydrogen nucleus is a fundamental particle, which he named the
            <em>proton</em>.
        </p>
        <p>The reaction can be represented as:</p>
        \[
        \ce{^14_7N + ^4_2He -> ^17_8O + ^1_1H}
        \]

        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>Rutherford’s work laid the foundation for modern atomic and nuclear physics. His nuclear model was later
            refined by
            Niels Bohr, leading to the development of quantum mechanics. Rutherford also mentored future scientists such
            as
            James Chadwick, who discovered the neutron, and Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron.</p>
        <p>Rutherford received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 for his investigations into the disintegration of
            elements
            and the chemistry of radioactive substances. He remains a towering figure in physics, whose insights
            fundamentally
            changed our understanding of matter.</p>
