This repository is mainly dedicated for the website created by myself. The name of this website would be 'Mathematical World'.
This website is hoped to ignite passion in Mathematics if the website is made accessible.
However, some more changes are necessary to develop this website further. If you want, you can provide me a request for forking here.
The code might seem very modest at first, but there are some fishy things here, that might surprise someone. No worries because there is nothing offensive in my code, but still fishy.
Especially if someone checks my CSS code (style.css), one might be astonished or even feel suffocated (!)
Anyways, hoping for enlightment in Mathematics! Hail Mathematics!
