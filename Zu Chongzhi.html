        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Zu Chongzhi</h3>
        <h4>Master of Pi and Chinese Astronomy</h4>
        <p>Zu Chongzhi (429–500 AD) was a Chinese mathematician, astronomer, and engineer whose contributions left a
            lasting
            mark on the scientific tradition of ancient China. He lived during the Liu Song and Southern Qi dynasties —
            a period
            of rich cultural and technological advancement. Zu is most famous for his extraordinarily precise
            approximation of π
            (pi), a record of accuracy that stood unmatched for nearly a thousand years.</p>
        <img src="Zu Chongzhi.webp" alt="Zu Chongzhi" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Early Life and Education</h4>
        <p>Born into a scholarly family, Zu Chongzhi displayed remarkable intellectual ability from an early age. His
            father and
            grandfather were both known for their academic achievements, and Zu received a thorough education in the
            Confucian
            classics as well as mathematics, astronomy, and engineering — the very fields where he would excel.</p>

        <h4>Mathematical Achievements</h4>
        <p>Zu Chongzhi’s most celebrated achievement was his approximation of π to between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927. This
            level
            of precision, known today as the <i>Milü</i> approximation (355/113), was unparalleled in the ancient world
            and
            remained the most accurate value used anywhere for over a millennium.</p>
        <p>Although the exact details of his method are unknown, historians believe Zu may have used polygonal
            approximations
            similar to those of Archimedes, refining them through iterative calculations — all without the tools of
            modern
            calculus or computation.</p>

        <h4>Contributions to Astronomy</h4>
        <p>Zu worked extensively on astronomical calculations, often collaborating with his son, Zu Gengzhi. Together
            they
            developed the <i>Daming Calendar</i>, which corrected inaccuracies in earlier Chinese lunar-solar calendars.
            This
            calendar measured the tropical year as 365.24281481 days — remarkably close to the modern value of
            365.24219878
            days.</p>

        <h4>Engineering and Inventions</h4>
        <p>Beyond pure theory, Zu Chongzhi was a skilled engineer. He designed water-powered machinery and mechanical
            devices,
            showing a keen interest in applying scientific knowledge to practical problems. His engineering expertise
            earned him
            positions at the imperial court, where he was entrusted with important astronomical and technical projects.
        </p>

        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>Although many of his original works have been lost, Zu Chongzhi’s influence endured through Chinese
            mathematics and
            astronomy. His innovations in numerical methods, calendar design, and mechanical engineering inspired
            generations of
            scholars. Today, he is celebrated both in China and worldwide as a polymath whose intellectual achievements
            bridged
            theory and application.</p>
        <p>Zu Chongzhi’s precise value for π and his astronomical insights remain enduring symbols of ancient China’s
            scientific
            ingenuity — proof that brilliant minds can transcend the limits of their time.</p>
