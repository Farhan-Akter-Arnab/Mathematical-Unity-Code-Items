        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Theon of Smyrna</h3>
        <h4>Philosopher-Mathematician of the Pythagorean Tradition</h4>
        <h5><i><strong>Not to be confused with <a href="Theon of Alexandria.html" style="color:white;">Theon of Alexandria!!! (Clickable Link)</a></strong></i></h5>
        <p>
            Theon of Smyrna (c. 70–c. 135 CE) was a Greek philosopher and mathematician whose writings reflect the enduring
            influence of Pythagorean thought in Late Antiquity. He is best known for his work <i>Exposition of Mathematical
                Matters Useful for Reading Plato</i>, which served as an introduction to mathematics for philosophical students.
        </p>
        <img src="Theon of Smyrna.jpeg" alt="Theon of Smyrna" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Theon's treatise is not a book of proofs in the Euclidean tradition but a pedagogical manual explaining the
            mathematical background necessary for understanding Plato’s dialogues. It covers arithmetic, music theory, geometry,
            and astronomy—essential components of the quadrivium. In arithmetic, he discusses the classification of numbers
            (even, odd, prime, composite, perfect, etc.) and the relationships between them. For example, he explains the notion
            of perfect numbers:
            \[
            \text{A number is perfect if } \sigma(n) = 2n,
            \]
            where \( \sigma(n) \) is the sum of divisors function.
        </p>
        <p>
            In music theory, Theon elaborates on the Pythagorean doctrine that musical harmony is governed by numerical ratios,
            such as \(2:1\) for the octave, \(3:2\) for the fifth, and \(4:3\) for the fourth. He also explains geometric
            concepts such as means—arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic—and their philosophical significance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Astronomy, in Theon’s presentation, follows the Platonic ideal that celestial bodies move in harmonious,
            mathematically describable patterns. While his astronomical content is elementary compared to Ptolemy’s, it
            reinforces the Pythagorean vision of a mathematically ordered cosmos.
        </p>
        <p>
            Theon’s work was preserved through Byzantine and Arabic translations, serving as a bridge between Greek philosophy
            and later medieval scholarship. Although he was not an innovator of mathematical theory, his synthesis of
            arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy exemplifies how mathematics was integrated into the broader intellectual
            culture of his time.
        </p>
        <p>
            His writings remind us that in antiquity, mathematics was not seen as an isolated discipline but as a pathway to
            understanding the universe and the philosophical truths within it.
