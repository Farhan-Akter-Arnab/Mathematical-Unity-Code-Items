        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Al-Sijzi</h3>
        <h4>Innovative Mathematician and Astronomer of the Islamic Golden Age</h4>
        <p>Al-Sijzi (c. 945 – c. 1020 CE), full name Abu Sa'id Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Jalil al-Sijzi, was a
            Persian
            mathematician and astronomer known for his original contributions to geometry, planetary theory, and
            astronomical
            instruments. He was born in Sijistan (present-day Sistan region spanning eastern Iran and southwestern
            Afghanistan)
            and was active in major scientific centers such as Baghdad and Shiraz.</p>
        <img src="Al-Sijzi.jpeg" alt="Al-Sijzi" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>In mathematics, Al-Sijzi made significant progress in geometry. He explored curves beyond the classical Greek
            approach, notably working on the <b>epicycloid</b> and conic sections. One of his most remarkable
            contributions was
            his proposed mechanical solution to angle trisection — a problem considered impossible using only compass
            and
            straightedge. He designed an ingenious geometric instrument called the <i>“Zahrawi’s compasses”</i> to aid
            this
            process, reflecting his deep understanding of practical geometry and mathematical instruments.</p>

        <p>Al-Sijzi was among the first to explicitly consider the possibility that the Earth rotates on its axis. While
            this
            idea was not widely accepted in his time, he defended it scientifically and built astronomical models based
            on a
            rotating Earth — a perspective that predated Copernican thought by several centuries.</p>

        <p>He also invented an astronomical device known as the <b>al-zūraqī astrolabe</b>, which assumed a rotating
            Earth,
            differing from the traditional Ptolemaic astrolabes. This bold theoretical innovation illustrates his
            departure from
            geocentric orthodoxy and shows how Islamic scholars like Al-Sijzi were engaging in conceptual
            experimentation far
            ahead of their era.</p>

        <p>Al-Sijzi authored works on spherical geometry, trigonometry, and planetary motions. He criticized and
            corrected parts
            of Ptolemaic astronomy and expanded upon Greek and Indian astronomical traditions, often through precise
            observational and mathematical techniques.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Proposed a rotating Earth centuries before Copernicus</li>
            <li>Designed instruments for solving angle trisection geometrically</li>
            <li>Developed the al-zūraqī astrolabe based on Earth's rotation</li>
            <li>Advanced conic sections and studied epicycloidal motion</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Al-Sijzi’s combination of theoretical creativity and mechanical ingenuity highlights his importance in the
            history of
            science. His willingness to challenge prevailing cosmological ideas reflects the intellectual boldness of
            Islamic
            scientific culture during its golden age.</p>
