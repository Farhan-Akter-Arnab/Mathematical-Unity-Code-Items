        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Ali Qushji</h3>
        <h4>Astronomer, Mathematician, and Philosopher of the Timurid and Ottoman Eras</h4>
        <p>Ali Qushji (c. 1403 – 1474 CE), full name Ala al-Dīn Ali ibn Muhammed al-Qushji, was a prominent astronomer,
            mathematician, physicist, and theologian of Central Asian origin. Born in Samarkand in present-day
            Uzbekistan, he
            studied under the famed astronomer Ulugh Beg and later worked in Constantinople (Istanbul) under Sultan
            Mehmed II.
            Qushji is notable for advancing observational astronomy, mathematical astronomy, and scientific philosophy
            during
            the late Islamic Golden Age.</p>
        <img src="Ali_Qushji.jpg" alt="Ali Qushji" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>Ali Qushji played a central role in developing the astronomical school of Samarkand, building on the works of
            earlier
            scholars such as Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. He was responsible for refining astronomical models based on
            observations
            made at the Ulugh Beg Observatory, one of the most advanced observatories of its time. His significant work
            <i>al-Risāla al-Fatḥiyya</i> on theoretical astronomy outlined planetary models and calculations that were
            free from
            the philosophical and cosmological assumptions typically associated with Aristotelian physics.
        </p>

        <p>In mathematics, Ali Qushji focused on mathematical astronomy and trigonometry. He contributed to calculations
            involving celestial movements, particularly lunar and planetary motions, and supported the use of empirical
            data
            over inherited theoretical assumptions. He further developed spherical trigonometry and improved the
            accuracy of
            astronomical tables used to predict planetary positions.</p>

        <p>One of Ali Qushji’s most significant philosophical contributions was his argument for the possibility of
            Earth's
            motion — he challenged the long-standing Aristotelian notion that Earth must be stationary. Though he did
            not claim
            that the Earth moves, his empirical approach to science left open the theoretical possibility, marking a
            step toward
            the later Copernican revolution.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Studied under Ulugh Beg and helped establish the Samarkand school of astronomy</li>
            <li>Proposed planetary models with refined astronomical calculations</li>
            <li>Separated astronomy from Aristotelian cosmology, supporting empirical methods</li>
            <li>Considered the possibility of Earth's motion based on observational reasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After the death of Ulugh Beg, Qushji migrated to the Ottoman Empire, where he taught at the Madrasah of
            Ayasofya in
            Istanbul and influenced Ottoman scientific thought. His works were translated into Persian and Turkish and
            circulated widely, influencing scholars well into the modern era. Ali Qushji stands as a bridge between
            classical
            Islamic science and the scientific developments that would later shape the Renaissance and early modern
            astronomy.
