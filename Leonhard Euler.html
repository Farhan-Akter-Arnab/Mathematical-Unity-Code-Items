        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Leonhard Euler</h3>
        <h4>One of History’s Most Prolific Mathematicians</h4>
        <p>Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) was one of the most prolific and influential mathematicians in history. Born in
            Basel,
            Switzerland, in 1707, Euler spent much of his life working in Russia and Prussia, where he produced an
            astonishing
            volume of mathematical work that shaped countless fields, from number theory and graph theory to fluid
            dynamics and
            astronomy.</p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Early Life and Education</h4>
        <p>Euler's mathematical talents were recognized early. He studied under Johann Bernoulli, one of the foremost
            mathematicians of the time, and by his early twenties, Euler was already publishing groundbreaking papers.
            In 1727,
            he moved to the Imperial Academy in St. Petersburg, Russia, at the invitation of Empress Catherine I. There,
            he
            initially worked in physiology and naval science before turning fully to mathematics.</p>
        <p>Later, Euler also served at the Berlin Academy under Frederick the Great, before eventually returning to St.
            Petersburg for the remainder of his life.</p>

        <h4>Mathematical Notation and Contributions</h4>
        <p>Euler’s contributions are so vast it’s difficult to encapsulate them all. He introduced much of the modern
            mathematical notation we still use today, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The concept of a function written as \( f(x) \)</li>
            <li>The use of \( e \) for the base of the natural logarithm</li>
            <li>The symbol \( i \) for the square root of -1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>His clarity in notation helped make mathematics more precise and expressive, influencing how future
            generations wrote
            and understood mathematics.</p>

        <h4>Euler’s Identity</h4>
        <p>One of Euler’s most famous contributions is <strong>Euler’s identity</strong>:</p>
        \[
        e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
        \]
        <p>This equation elegantly connects five of the most important constants in mathematics — \( e \), \( i \), \(
            \pi \),
            1, and 0 — in a single relationship. It is often described as a "mathematical poem" for its beauty and
            simplicity.
        </p>

        <h4>Achievements in Number Theory</h4>
        <p>In number theory, Euler extended Fermat's work, introducing the <em>Euler totient function</em> and proving
            numerous
            results involving prime numbers. He also solved the famous Basel problem, determining that the infinite
            series of
            reciprocal squares converges to:</p>
        \[
        \frac{\pi^2}{6}
        \]
        <p>This result stunned the mathematical world and demonstrated Euler’s exceptional insight and creativity.</p>

        <h4>Contributions to Physics and Applied Mathematics</h4>
        <p>Beyond pure mathematics, Euler made major contributions to physics, particularly in mechanics and
            hydrodynamics. He
            formulated <em>Euler’s equations</em> governing the motion of fluids, worked on the theory of elasticity,
            and laid
            the foundations for the calculus of variations — a branch of mathematics essential in modern physics and
            engineering.</p>

        <h4>Work Despite Blindness</h4>
        <p>Amazingly, Euler continued producing world-class mathematics even after losing vision in one eye — and later
            becoming
            completely blind. His mental faculties remained as sharp as ever. He dictated entire volumes of mathematics
            while
            blind, relying on his incredible memory and computational skill.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that Euler produced over 800 papers and books — a legacy unmatched by almost any
            mathematician in
            history.</p>

        <h4>Final Years and Legacy</h4>
        <p>Leonhard Euler passed away in 1783, reportedly after experiencing a brain hemorrhage shortly after discussing
            the
            orbit of Uranus. He left behind not just a towering body of work, but a legacy that would shape modern
            science,
            engineering, and mathematics.</p>
        <p>Euler’s influence is so far-reaching that many of today’s mathematical tools, techniques, and notations owe
            their
            origins directly to him. From the simplest formulas to the most advanced theories, Euler’s ideas remain at
            the heart
            of mathematics.</p>
