        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Hero (Heron) of Alexandria</h3>
        <h4>Pioneer of Applied Mathematics, Geometry, and Ingenious Devices</h4>
        <p>
            Hero (or Heron) of Alexandria (fl. c. 60 CE) was a Greek engineer and mathematician whose writings bridged the gap
            between theoretical mathematics and practical mechanical applications. Working in the Roman province of Egypt, Hero
            authored influential treatises such as <i>Metrica</i>, <i>Pneumatica</i>, and <i>Automata</i>. His fame in
            mathematics largely stems from his method for calculating the area of a triangle given its three sides, now known as
            <b>Heron’s Formula</b>. In modern notation, for a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the area \(A\) is
            given by:
            \[
            A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
            \]
            where \(s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}\) is the semiperimeter. This elegant formula remains widely taught today for its
            efficiency and beauty.
        </p>
        <img src="Hero.webp" alt="Hero of Alexandria" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Hero also made significant advances in geometry, describing approximations of square roots and offering practical
            solutions for measuring irregular shapes. His work extended beyond pure mathematics into mechanical engineering,
            where he designed automata—self-operating machines powered by steam, water, or air pressure. The most famous example
            is the <i>aeolipile</i>, an early steam engine consisting of a rotating sphere that demonstrated the conversion of
            steam pressure into rotary motion. While primarily a scientific curiosity in his time, it foreshadowed the
            principles of modern steam engines.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to geometric and mechanical work, Hero’s writings reveal a strong pedagogical intent. His explanations
            combined clear step-by-step procedures with real-world examples, making him an important link between ancient Greek
            theoretical traditions and the practical needs of engineers, surveyors, and craftsmen. His blend of theory and
            application influenced later Byzantine, Islamic, and European scholars, ensuring that his works were copied and
            studied for centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hero’s legacy lies not only in specific formulas or inventions but also in his vision of mathematics as a tool for
            solving tangible problems. He showed that abstract reasoning could be married to practical ingenuity—a principle
            that still resonates in modern engineering and applied science.
