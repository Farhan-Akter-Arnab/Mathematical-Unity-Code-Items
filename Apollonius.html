        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Apollonius of Perga (c. 262 BCE – c. 190 BCE)</h3>
        <h4>The Great Geometer and Founder of Conic Sections</h4>
        
        <p>
            Apollonius of Perga was a Greek mathematician renowned for his groundbreaking work in <b>geometry</b>, especially
            his systematic study of <b>conic sections</b>.
            Born in <b>Perga</b> (in modern-day Turkey) and educated in <b>Alexandria</b>, the intellectual hub of the ancient
            world, Apollonius combined rigorous geometric reasoning with astonishing creativity.
            Because of his achievements, he is often remembered as <b>“The Great Geometer.”</b>
        </p>
        <img src="Apollonius.jpg" alt="Apollonius" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <h4>Conic Sections</h4>
        <p>
            Apollonius is most famous for his monumental work <i>Conics</i>, where he studied the curves formed when a plane
            intersects a cone.
            These curves — <b>circle, ellipse, parabola,</b> and <b>hyperbola</b> — remain fundamental in mathematics, physics,
            and engineering.
            They describe planetary orbits, satellite paths, trajectories of projectiles, and principles of optics.
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Equations (modern form):</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Circle: \[x^2 + y^2 = r^2\]</li>
            <li>Ellipse: \[\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\]</li>
            <li>Parabola: \[y^2 = 4ax\]</li>
            <li>Hyperbola: \[\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\]</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Although Apollonius lived long before algebraic symbolism, he derived these relationships using <b>geometry</b> and
            <b>proportions</b>.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Names and Classifications</h4>
        <p>
            Apollonius introduced the names <b>parabola, ellipse,</b> and <b>hyperbola</b>, terms still used today.
            He explained their differences based on how the cutting plane intersects the cone:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ellipse</b>: plane cuts the cone at a shallow angle.</li>
            <li><b>Parabola</b>: plane runs parallel to the side of the cone.</li>
            <li><b>Hyperbola</b>: plane cuts through both nappes of a double cone.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Astronomy and Planetary Motion</h4>
        <p>
            Apollonius’ ideas profoundly influenced <b>astronomy</b>.
            Many centuries later, <b>Johannes Kepler</b> used ellipses to describe planetary orbits around the Sun — a direct
            legacy of Apollonius’ geometry.
            He also studied <b>epicycles and deferents</b>, geometric models later adopted by Ptolemy in the <i>Almagest</i> to
            explain planetary motion.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Other Contributions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tangents and Normals</b>: laid groundwork for differential geometry and calculus.</li>
            <li><b>Optics</b>: investigated reflection and refraction on curved surfaces, including parabolic mirrors (used in
                modern telescopes).</li>
            <li><b>Approximation methods</b>: developed techniques to approximate curves using simpler figures.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p>
            Apollonius’ <i>Conics</i> originally spanned eight books, of which seven survive (some in Greek, some preserved
            through Arabic translations).
            His work was admired by later giants such as <b>Newton</b>, <b>Descartes</b>, and <b>Kepler</b>, who extended his
            insights to build the foundations of modern physics and astronomy.
            Apollonius stands as one of the greatest minds of ancient mathematics, rivaled only by <b>Euclid</b> and
            <b>Archimedes</b>, with a legacy that seamlessly bridges geometry, science, and real-world application.
