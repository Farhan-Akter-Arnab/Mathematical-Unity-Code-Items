        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Ulugh Beg, the Mathematician Sultan</h3>
        <p><b>Muhammad Taraghay <code>Ulugh Beg</code></b> was the fourth Sultan of the Timurid Empire. He was the
            descendant of
            the worldwide known <em>Amir Timur (Tamerlane)</em>. Interestingly, he was a Sultan,
            <code>mathematician</code> and
            <code>astronomer</code> at the same time. He was born on 22 March, 1394 at Sultaniyeh in Timurid Empire. The
            mighty ruler <em>Amir Timur (Tamerlane)</em> was ruling the empire at that time.
        </p>
        <img src="Ulugh-Beg.webp" style="float: right; height: 250px;">
        <p>Ulugh Beg composed a star catalogue consisting of 1018 stars, which is eleven fewer stars than are present in
            the
            star catalogue of Ptolemy.Throughout his life as an astronomer, Ulugh Beg came to realize that there were
            multiple
            mistakes in the work and subsequent data of Ptolemy that had been in use for many years. Not only that, he
            also
            mentioned almost accurate measurements for the sidereal year (<abbr
                title="with an error of +58 seconds, actual time is around 365 days 6 hours 11 minutes and 6 seconds">365
                days 6
                hours 10 minutes and 8 seconds)</abbr>, and for the tropical year, he mentioned <abbr
                title="with an error of +28 seconds, actual time= 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes and 40 seconds">365 days 5
                hours
                49 minutes and 15 seconds</abbr>, which was more accurate than Copernicus' estimate.</p>
        <p>He also discovered the <code>obliquity of the elliptic</code>, which was very important in the study of
            astronomy. He
            was also a great mathematician, with keen interests in trigonometry. He wrote trigonometric tables of sine
            and
            tangent values, accurate to at least eight decimal places.</p>
        <p>Ulugh Beg was made governor of Samarqand in Timurid Empire under the reign of his father, Shah Rukh Mirza. He
            built
            the great Ulugh Beg Observatory in Samarqand between 1424 and 1429, which was one of the finest
            observatories in
            Islamic world and largest in Central Asia at that time. He also built the Ulugh Beg Madrasah from 1417 to
            1420 in
            Samarqand and Bukhara. He was known as the most important observational astronomer by many scholars from the
            15th
            century AD.</p>
        <p>However, despite being such a great mathematician and astronomer, Ulugh Beg was made the Sultan of Timurid
            Empire on
            March 13, 1447, a day before the <abbr
                title="Although unknown at that time, Mathematics Day is the date of March 14, corresponding to the first digits of π (3.14)">Mathematics
                Day</abbr>. However, his reign was short-lived, and full of struggles. The war of succession caused the
            Timurid
            Empire to become fragmented, with <abbr title="his nephew">Ala-ad-Dawla and Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza</abbr>
            declaring
            as the Sultan. Ulugh Beg went to encounter them, with defeating the first, but being defeated against the
            second.
            Not only that, his Sultanate was also being conquered by the rival Jahan Shah ibn Yusuf of the Qara Qoyunlu,
            a
            Turkoman dynasty closely related to Azerbaijanis. Ulugh Beg had to surrender to his son Abdul-Latif Mirza,
            who
            granted him the permission to go for Hajj. However, Abdul-Latif assassinated his mathematician father on his
            route
            for Hajj on 27 October 1449.</p><br>
