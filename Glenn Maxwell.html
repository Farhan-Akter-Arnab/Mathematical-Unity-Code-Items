        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Glenn Maxwell</h3>
        <h4>Australian Cricketer Known as "The Big Show"</h4>
        <p>
            Glenn James Maxwell (born October 14, 1988) is an Australian international cricketer celebrated for his explosive
            batting, inventive shot-making, and ability to change the course of a match within a few overs. Nicknamed “The Big
            Show” for his flair and audacious stroke-play, Maxwell has become one of the most entertaining and influential
            all-rounders in modern cricket, excelling across formats, particularly in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20
            Internationals (T20Is).
        </p>

            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Maxwell began his cricketing journey in Victoria, quickly gaining attention for his aggressive batting style. He
            rose to prominence in 2011–2012 with a record-breaking fastest fifty in Australian domestic one-day cricket. Shortly
            afterward, he made his international debut, representing Australia in limited-overs cricket. His unique strength
            lies in his 360-degree range of strokes: reverse sweeps, switch-hits, lofted drives, and improvisational flicks that
            unsettle bowlers. These unconventional skills align with the needs of modern short-format cricket, where innovation
            and quick scoring are paramount.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to batting, Maxwell contributes with his off-spin bowling and sharp fielding. He has often been deployed
            as a partnership-breaking bowler in the middle overs, while his reflexes and athleticism in the field make him one
            of the most reliable fielders in world cricket. His versatility has made him indispensable in franchise leagues such
            as the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he has represented multiple teams, becoming a fan favorite for his ability
            to entertain and deliver under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maxwell’s international career highlights include playing a vital role in Australia’s 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup
            triumph, where his aggressive batting provided crucial momentum in the middle order. He also holds one of the
            fastest centuries in World Cup history, scored against Sri Lanka in just 51 balls. Beyond World Cups, he has notched
            remarkable innings, including double centuries in ODIs and match-winning T20 knocks, showcasing both endurance and
            innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond statistics, Maxwell’s impact lies in his redefinition of batting possibilities. By normalizing audacious
            strokes and aggressive strategies, he has influenced a new generation of cricketers to embrace creativity. While
            critics sometimes point to inconsistency, his ability to single-handedly dominate games underscores his value. Glenn
            Maxwell remains an emblem of modern cricket’s bold, dynamic spirit—simultaneously an entertainer and a match-winner.
