        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Kikuchi Dairoku</h3>
        <h4>Promoter of Mathematics and Science in Modern Japan</h4>
        <p>
            Kikuchi Dairoku (1855–1917) was a Japanese mathematician, educator, and statesman who became one of the
            first
            Japanese scholars to receive formal training in mathematics abroad. He studied at University College London
            and the
            University of Cambridge, where he was exposed to modern Western mathematical thought, including analysis and
            geometry. Returning to Japan, he brought back advanced ideas that helped shape the nation’s education system
            during
            the Meiji Restoration.
        </p>
        <img src="Kikuchi Dairoku.jpeg" alt="Kikuchi Dairoku" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>
            Kikuchi specialized in geometry and the theory of numbers, with particular interest in conic sections and
            analytical
            methods. He also emphasized the importance of rigorous proofs and logical structure in mathematical
            education,
            reflecting the influence of European traditions. His academic work included studies in algebraic identities
            and
            properties of curves, often expressed using symbolic forms such as quadratic equations:
            \
            which describe general conic sections. By promoting such analytical tools, he aligned Japan with global
            standards in
            mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond his scholarly work, Kikuchi played a leading role in Japanese higher education. He became president
            of Tokyo
            Imperial University and later served as Japan’s Minister of Education. His reforms emphasized scientific
            literacy,
            teacher training, and the development of mathematics as both a practical and theoretical discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kikuchi’s influence extended into policy-making, where he worked to modernize Japan’s curriculum and promote
            international exchange. His life illustrates the transformation of Japan into a modern nation through
            science and
            education, and he remains an important figure in both mathematics and national development.
