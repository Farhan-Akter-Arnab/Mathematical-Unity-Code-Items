        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Mathematical Village!</h3>
        <p>It is natural to become highly astonished, because no one ever has let most of the readers to know that such a
            mathematical village exists in this world. Please do not worry, as there are already two such mathematical villages
            in the world. Both of them are situated in Turkey. These two villages are
            <b><code>Nesin Mathematical Village</code></b>, and <b><code>Cakilarasi Mathematical Village</code></b>.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Nesin Mathematical Village</dt>
            <dd>
                <p><abbr title="Turkish: Nesin Matematik Köyü"><b>Nesin Mathematical Village</b></abbr> is the most important of
                    the mathematical villages in Turkey. It is a educational and research centre devoted for
                    <code>mathematics</code>, situated 800 m from Sirince village in Selcuk District of Izmir Province in
                    Western Turkey.</p>
                <img src="250px-Nesin_Matematik_Köyü_Bina.jpg" style="float: right;">
                <p>It was launched in 2007 by Ali Nesin, a veteran mathematics professor, who heads up education non-profit
                    Nesin Foundation established by his father, humorist writer Aziz Nesin (1915–1995). The Nesin Mathematics
                    Village hosts numerous mathematical activities, mostly taken in summer. Courses range from <abbr
                        title="Unfortunately, not for us">high-school to graduate university courses</abbr>, where courses are
                    delivered mainly in Turkish, and may be in English for undergraduate or postgraduate courses.</p>
                <img src="Ali Nesin.jpeg" style="float: left; width: 324px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;">
                <p>Ali Nesin's mathematical research area is "Groups of finite Morley rank". He is also the responsible editor
                    of the journal named Matematik Dünyası, which has been published quarterly since 2003 and owned by the
                    Turkish Mathematical Society. In addition, he has lecture notes on set theory and analysis accepted by the
                    Turkish Academy of Sciences.</p>

                <p>As like other mathematical incidents, Nesin Mathematical Village was <b style="color:red;">not</b> spare of
                    struggle. In July 2007, Tekin Karadağ, the president of the Şirince Environment and Nature Association,
                    slated this village to be demolished because of it being "an illegal construction", with objectives of being
                    a rump foundation in a remote forest in the midst of remoteness in nature. Fortunately, Allah Ta'ala saved
                    this mathematical village. Harun Abuş, Director of Development and City Planning of Selçuk Municipality,
                    declared that at this moment Nesin Mathematics Village is "not on the demolition calendar".</p>

            <dt>Cakilarasi Mathematical Village</dt>
            <dd>
                <p><abbr title="Turkish: Çakılarası Matematik Köyü"><b>The Çakılarası Mathematics Village</b></abbr> is the second
                    educational and research institute devoted to mathematics in Turkey. This village is located in Sarıcakaya,
                    <abbr title="The city of Osman Ghazi !">Eskişehir.</abbr></p>
                <img src="Çakılarası Matematik Koyu.jpg" style="float: right; height: 124px;">
                <p>As like Nesin Mathematical Village, Çakılarası Mathematical Village is also situated in a remote area, offering
                    courses only to graduate students. They have a scheduled time of just 20 hours in total every week. The students
                    must bring their own bed sheets for sleep. They have their breakfast and lunch as watermelon-cheese-bread. They
                    learn mathematics within nature as well.</p>
