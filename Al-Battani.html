        <h1>Welcome to the Mathematical World!</h1>
        <h3>Al-Battani</h3>
        <h4>Refiner of Astronomical Observations and Trigonometric Pioneer</h4>
        <p>Al-Battani (c. 858 – 929 CE), also known in Latin as Albatenius, was an Arab astronomer, mathematician, and
            astrologer whose observational precision and theoretical contributions had a profound impact on both Islamic
            and
            European astronomy. He was born in Harran (in modern-day Turkey) and later worked in Raqqa, Syria, under the
            Abbasid
            Caliphate.</p>
        <img src="Al-Battani.png" alt="Al-Battani" class="img-fluid"
            style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px; float:right;">
        <p>His most influential work is the astronomical treatise <i>Kitāb al-Zīj</i> (The Book of Astronomical Tables),
            often
            referred to as the <b>Zīj al-Sābi’</b>. This comprehensive work included detailed planetary models, eclipse
            calculations, solar and lunar tables, and refined values for celestial phenomena. His observations were so
            accurate
            that they remained in use for centuries and were frequently referenced by later astronomers such as
            Copernicus and
            Tycho Brahe.</p>

        <p>In mathematics, Al-Battani made important contributions to <b>trigonometry</b>. He replaced the use of Greek
            chords
            with modern sine functions, thereby simplifying computations. He established key trigonometric relationships
            and
            identities, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\[\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\]</li>
            <li>\[\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He also compiled accurate tables of sines and tangents and introduced improved techniques for solving
            right-angled
            and spherical triangles, helping to separate trigonometry from astronomy as an independent discipline.</p>

        <p>Al-Battani calculated the length of the solar year as 365 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes, and 24 seconds — only
            two
            minutes off the modern value. He also refined values for the inclination of the Earth's axis, the precession
            of the
            equinoxes, and the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. His observations were based on nearly 40 years of
            systematic
            data collection using instruments like the armillary sphere and the mural quadrant.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Replaced Ptolemaic chord functions with modern sine and tangent functions</li>
            <li>Compiled precise astronomical tables and trigonometric identities</li>
            <li>Calculated the solar year length with remarkable accuracy</li>
            <li>Influenced Copernicus and European Renaissance astronomy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Al-Battani's <i>Zīj</i> was translated into Latin in the 12th century and widely used in Europe under the
            title <i>De
                Scientia Stellarum</i>. His blend of observational rigor and mathematical innovation ensured that his
            legacy
            shaped both Islamic and Western scientific traditions.</p>
